Kosmozuikis	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kosmozuikis/	Sometimes simplicity is all you need, no words, no fancy graphics, just beautiful art to deliver a powerful messageFlorence is a very short interactive story of a girl and some stages of her life. It's simple, lasts only for about and hour but has a huge impact on you.The idea along with the artstyle is really neat. The whole gameplay is just scrolling through images sometimes doing simple tasks. But those tasks usually have a deeper meaning. There are some moving scenes, again with a meaning.It's a very heartwarming and maybe a little heartbreaking story but so is life. A lot of people will see themselves in this game, same stuff many people go through in their life.Sometimes you need a little push to go on. You make memories, you reminisce about the past, think about how life has changed and how you changed. Falling in love, getting to know that person which at first might seem difficult. Big hurtful words you say without thinking. All the hardships and joyful moments of your life.  But you need to remember even if everything falls down you can start painting your world with colors again. It's all there, represented through simple yet beautiful art. Puzzles (this part completely got me), coloring, walking, it's beautiful. I don't know what it is, but this game has something which triggers emotions and makes you think, maybe go to your partner and hug him/her, tell your mother you love her.Graphically it's very minimalistic but beautifully drawn. Not a lot to talk about graphics.No ultrawide for obvious reasons. Performance? No need to talk about it, if your PC can show pictures it will run this game.Music is really nice and it reflects the emotions your going through but I wish there would be a better transition when music changes.Get this if you appreciate art and interactive stories. The game is great but it's very short, sure it's only 5€ but i'd still suggest waiting for a sale. But hey at least it's not 20€ like Gone Home (loved it too btw, but the price...).ProsBeautiful artGood musicYour life on a plateConsCould be a little longerFollow my curator page for more

The game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it.  What's inside? Story is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling.  Conclusion I highly recommend this game for anyone with feeeels and without. It's short, but as they say it "packs a punch".

People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.It paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that "routine" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.I liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters.

Bō / Toni	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055802307/	- Act I - Crush What to do on your sad Valentine's day, when you've canceled your own pity party and felt betrayed by your own feelings? Simple. To play the mobile game you've been hearing some good stuff about, which has been given a surprising Steam release. That's how I was introduced to Florence, anyway. I will skip that part of the game winning every possible award and beating all the best mobile games back when it was originally released. You most likely know that already. Besides, it's not that important. The feelings and experience are all that matters. As Maya Angelou famously said: I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. The same is fair for video games - you may forget many details about them, but you will always remember how some of them made you feel. And Florence? Quality emotions delivery service at the click of your mouse!  - Act II - Happy TogetherA wholesome and elegant mix of webcomic, puzzle game, and walking simulator elements will tell you a simple, ordinary even, story about day-to-day routine, escapism, dreams, first love, pain, inspiration, frustration, forgiveness. The story, relevant to many yet somewhat uniquely special for you. It's almost a self-help 'narrative' for your struggling adult life - although, I might have watched too many motivational youtube videos, so let's move on.Gameplay difficulty is at zero level, however, it's still quite enjoyable going through mini-games and being a part of interactive storytelling. Controls are quite simple, but I would recommend using your mouse, as it's more convenient (you will see why), but there's full controller support, if you prefer. Florence is unquestionably linear, but the illusion of choice and different interpretations of your own experience may give you something to ponder about at the end. I say: play it twice. The first time, when you are sad; the second time when you are happy. Test your emotions. Embrace the routine. Improve your St Valentine's Day.- Act III - RoutineOnce you beat the game, you'll have access to all the chapters separately, which is useful, if you want to go through all the achievements. It took me about an hour to complete 30 mins game which felt like a brief moment. I wanted more and I played it again. You know it's good when the time feels faster than it actually is. There are also rumors you can speedrun this game for ~15 mins, but I'm not even sure why I'm telling you this? Music also plays a significant role - it's quite lighthearted, but so on point and will dictate the swings of your mood. The original soundtrack is included, so you can listen to it anytime.- Act IV - The EndIn short: it's when simplicity beats everything. It is a simple yet beautiful experience, and after that short period of time with Florence you may forget the details, but you will remember how this game made you feel. Give it a try. Special thank you to the wonderful Samurai Punk team, who have ported this game to both PC & Switch and made this experience possible!  PS: Thank you all for reading - appreciate your time! Much love ~
kgsizemo	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198202715070/	My girl does not like crust! ---- SPOILERS!!!! ---- First, let me say that the score for this game is phenomenal! O.k., now that I've addressed that aspect, I will continue with my take on the game's plot.This plot reminds me of one of my favorite movies, La La Land. Although they are technically love stories, both Florence and La La Land have this seemingly tragic element to them. The relationships do not last. This does not mean that the time spent in said relationships were wasted.In Florence's case, both characters were stuck in ruts before they met, just going through the day-to-day motions. Once they met, and eventually began dating, they started to open up and share their thoughts. Their passions. Because they both developed care and affection for each other, they each pushed one another to pursue said passions. If not for Florence, Krish would not have applied for the music academy; If not for Krish, Florence might not have chased her dream of becoming an artist.Both Florence and Krish set one another on a better path than they were on.While Florence and Krish did not end up together, both hugely impacted one another. This is not a sad story. Sometimes people come into your life only for a season... and it can be a beautiful season! Just because the relationship did not last, that does not mean the memories, lessons, or admiration for the other person has to end as well.This game is good. Check it out.

Bodomi	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bodomi/	Florence is an overpriced 30-minute short novel with an un-relatable, and in my opinion horrible story and extremely monotonous 'puzzles'/mini-games that feels like homework for a young child, matching geometrical shapes together and solving math problems like 8+?=16.What I grasp from the moral of story is that: moms are annoying, digital things are bad, anything but homemade cultural meals are negative, a stable relationship with routine is bad, and a good career change in your mid-20's is to start doing something you did as a toddler and never again after that.The art and music is really good but I don't give games positive reviews because they had a wonderful art-style and good soundtrack, unlike most of the people who have given this game a positive review.In the end it sucked. It was boring, the moral of the story was horrible and the last half of the game was just a bunch of fanciful nonsense that would never happen in reality.It's a banal and dull love story. It tries to be deep, but it really isn't.If the game was longer with a lot more detail on how the 2 main characters relationship developed and way more detail on how she continued her sudden artist career it could maybe be a mediocre thing and not a waste of money, but not this 30-minute crap story with a very sudden ending of her deciding to pursue an art career because she drew as a child, like 99% of all children in her shoes did.Curator pageIf you liked this review or otherwise found it helpful in deciding whether or not to buy this game, feel free to follow my Curator page.Edit: All of a sudden my Steam Curator page link is being censored in this review, shows up just fine in all my other reviews.Edit edit: And it's back, after several hours.Edit edit edit: And a few days ago the review was completely removed from the store page.

Bodomi	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bodomi/	Florence is an overpriced 30-minute short novel with an un-relatable, and in my opinion horrible story and extremely monotonous 'puzzles'/mini-games that feels like homework for a young child, matching geometrical shapes together and solving math problems like 8+?=16.What I grasp from the moral of story is that: moms are annoying, digital things are bad, anything but homemade cultural meals are negative, a stable relationship with routine is bad, and a good career change in your mid-20's is to start doing something you did as a toddler and never again after that.The art and music is really good but I don't give games positive reviews because they had a wonderful art-style and good soundtrack, unlike most of the people who have given this game a positive review.In the end it sucked. It was boring, the moral of the story was horrible and the last half of the game was just a bunch of fanciful nonsense that would never happen in reality.It's a banal and dull love story. It tries to be deep, but it really isn't.If the game was longer with a lot more detail on how the 2 main characters relationship developed and way more detail on how she continued her sudden artist career it could maybe be a mediocre thing and not a waste of money, but not this 30-minute crap story with a very sudden ending of her deciding to pursue an art career because she drew as a child, like 99% of all children in her shoes did.Curator pageIf you liked this review or otherwise found it helpful in deciding whether or not to buy this game, feel free to follow my Curator page.Edit: All of a sudden my Steam Curator page link is being censored in this review, shows up just fine in all my other reviews.Edit edit: And it's back, after several hours.Edit edit edit: And a few days ago the review was completely removed from the store page.

Kosmozuikis	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kosmozuikis/	Sometimes simplicity is all you need, no words, no fancy graphics, just beautiful art to deliver a powerful messageFlorence is a very short interactive story of a girl and some stages of her life. It's simple, lasts only for about and hour but has a huge impact on you.The idea along with the artstyle is really neat. The whole gameplay is just scrolling through images sometimes doing simple tasks. But those tasks usually have a deeper meaning. There are some moving scenes, again with a meaning.It's a very heartwarming and maybe a little heartbreaking story but so is life. A lot of people will see themselves in this game, same stuff many people go through in their life.Sometimes you need a little push to go on. You make memories, you reminisce about the past, think about how life has changed and how you changed. Falling in love, getting to know that person which at first might seem difficult. Big hurtful words you say without thinking. All the hardships and joyful moments of your life.  But you need to remember even if everything falls down you can start painting your world with colors again. It's all there, represented through simple yet beautiful art. Puzzles (this part completely got me), coloring, walking, it's beautiful. I don't know what it is, but this game has something which triggers emotions and makes you think, maybe go to your partner and hug him/her, tell your mother you love her.Graphically it's very minimalistic but beautifully drawn. Not a lot to talk about graphics.No ultrawide for obvious reasons. Performance? No need to talk about it, if your PC can show pictures it will run this game.Music is really nice and it reflects the emotions your going through but I wish there would be a better transition when music changes.Get this if you appreciate art and interactive stories. The game is great but it's very short, sure it's only 5€ but i'd still suggest waiting for a sale.

The game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it.  What's inside? Story is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling.

i_Go_SpLaT	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/i_Go_SpLaT/	Started strong, ended annoyingly.Moral of the story? People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.It paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that "routine" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.I liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.At least it was short. 
Bō / Toni	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055802307/	- Act I - Crush What to do on your sad Valentine's day, when you've canceled your own pity party and felt betrayed by your own feelings? Simple. To play the mobile game you've been hearing some good stuff about, which has been given a surprising Steam release. That's how I was introduced to Florence, anyway. I will skip that part of the game winning every possible award and beating all the best mobile games back when it was originally released. You most likely know that already. Besides, it's not that important. The feelings and experience are all that matters. As Maya Angelou famously said: I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. The same is fair for video games - you may forget many details about them, but you will always remember how some of them made you feel. And Florence? Quality emotions delivery service at the click of your mouse!  - Act II - Happy TogetherA wholesome and elegant mix of webcomic, puzzle game, and walking simulator elements will tell you a simple, ordinary even, story about day-to-day routine, escapism, dreams, first love, pain, inspiration, frustration, forgiveness. The story, relevant to many yet somewhat uniquely special for you. It's almost a self-help 'narrative' for your struggling adult life - although, I might have watched too many motivational youtube videos, so let's move on.Gameplay difficulty is at zero level, however, it's still quite enjoyable going through mini-games and being a part of interactive storytelling. Controls are quite simple, but I would recommend using your mouse, as it's more convenient (you will see why), but there's full controller support, if you prefer. Florence is unquestionably linear, but the illusion of choice and different interpretations of your own experience may give you something to ponder about at the end. I say: play it twice. The first time, when you are sad; the second time when you are happy. Test your emotions. Embrace the routine. Improve your St Valentine's Day.- Act III - RoutineOnce you beat the game, you'll have access to all the chapters separately, which is useful, if you want to go through all the achievements. It took me about an hour to complete 30 mins game which felt like a brief moment. I wanted more and I played it again. You know it's good when the time feels faster than it actually is. There are also rumors you can speedrun this game for ~15 mins, but I'm not even sure why I'm telling you this? Music also plays a significant role - it's quite lighthearted, but so on point and will dictate the swings of your mood. The original soundtrack is included, so you can listen to it anytime.- Act IV - The EndIn short: it's when simplicity beats everything. It is a simple yet beautiful experience, and after that short period of time with Florence you may forget the details, but you will remember how this game made you feel. Give it a try.

People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.It paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that "routine" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.I liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.At least it was short. 
Bō / Toni	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055802307/	- Act I - Crush What to do on your sad Valentine's day, when you've canceled your own pity party and felt betrayed by your own feelings? Simple. To play the mobile game you've been hearing some good stuff about, which has been given a surprising Steam release. That's how I was introduced to Florence, anyway. I will skip that part of the game winning every possible award and beating all the best mobile games back when it was originally released. You most likely know that already. Besides, it's not that important. The feelings and experience are all that matters. As Maya Angelou famously said: I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. The same is fair for video games - you may forget many details about them, but you will always remember how some of them made you feel. And Florence? Quality emotions delivery service at the click of your mouse!  - Act II - Happy TogetherA wholesome and elegant mix of webcomic, puzzle game, and walking simulator elements will tell you a simple, ordinary even, story about day-to-day routine, escapism, dreams, first love, pain, inspiration, frustration, forgiveness. The story, relevant to many yet somewhat uniquely special for you. It's almost a self-help 'narrative' for your struggling adult life - although, I might have watched too many motivational youtube videos, so let's move on.Gameplay difficulty is at zero level, however, it's still quite enjoyable going through mini-games and being a part of interactive storytelling. Controls are quite simple, but I would recommend using your mouse, as it's more convenient (you will see why), but there's full controller support, if you prefer. Florence is unquestionably linear, but the illusion of choice and different interpretations of your own experience may give you something to ponder about at the end. I say: play it twice. The first time, when you are sad; the second time when you are happy. Test your emotions. Embrace the routine. Improve your St Valentine's Day.- Act III - RoutineOnce you beat the game, you'll have access to all the chapters separately, which is useful, if you want to go through all the achievements. It took me about an hour to complete 30 mins game which felt like a brief moment. I wanted more and I played it again. You know it's good when the time feels faster than it actually is. There are also rumors you can speedrun this game for ~15 mins, but I'm not even sure why I'm telling you this? Music also plays a significant role - it's quite lighthearted, but so on point and will dictate the swings of your mood. The original soundtrack is included, so you can listen to it anytime.- Act IV - The EndIn short: it's when simplicity beats everything. It is a simple yet beautiful experience, and after that short period of time with Florence you may forget the details, but you will remember how this game made you feel. Give it a try. Special thank you to the wonderful Samurai Punk team, who have ported this game to both PC & Switch and made this experience possible!  PS: Thank you all for reading - appreciate your time! Much love ~

O.k., now that I've addressed that aspect, I will continue with my take on the game's plot.This plot reminds me of one of my favorite movies, La La Land. Although they are technically love stories, both Florence and La La Land have this seemingly tragic element to them. The relationships do not last. This does not mean that the time spent in said relationships were wasted.In Florence's case, both characters were stuck in ruts before they met, just going through the day-to-day motions. Once they met, and eventually began dating, they started to open up and share their thoughts. Their passions. Because they both developed care and affection for each other, they each pushed one another to pursue said passions. If not for Florence, Krish would not have applied for the music academy; If not for Krish, Florence might not have chased her dream of becoming an artist.Both Florence and Krish set one another on a better path than they were on.While Florence and Krish did not end up together, both hugely impacted one another. This is not a sad story. Sometimes people come into your life only for a season... and it can be a beautiful season! Just because the relationship did not last, that does not mean the memories, lessons, or admiration for the other person has to end as well.This game is good. Check it out.

Bodomi	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bodomi/	Florence is an overpriced 30-minute short novel with an un-relatable, and in my opinion horrible story and extremely monotonous 'puzzles'/mini-games that feels like homework for a young child, matching geometrical shapes together and solving math problems like 8+?=16.What I grasp from the moral of story is that: moms are annoying, digital things are bad, anything but homemade cultural meals are negative, a stable relationship with routine is bad, and a good career change in your mid-20's is to start doing something you did as a toddler and never again after that.The art and music is really good but I don't give games positive reviews because they had a wonderful art-style and good soundtrack, unlike most of the people who have given this game a positive review.In the end it sucked. It was boring, the moral of the story was horrible and the last half of the game was just a bunch of fanciful nonsense that would never happen in reality.It's a banal and dull love story. It tries to be deep, but it really isn't.If the game was longer with a lot more detail on how the 2 main characters relationship developed and way more detail on how she continued her sudden artist career it could maybe be a mediocre thing and not a waste of money, but not this 30-minute crap story with a very sudden ending of her deciding to pursue an art career because she drew as a child, like 99% of all children in her shoes did.Curator pageIf you liked this review or otherwise found it helpful in deciding whether or not to buy this game, feel free to follow my Curator page.Edit: All of a sudden my Steam Curator page link is being censored in this review, shows up just fine in all my other reviews.Edit edit: And it's back, after several hours.Edit edit edit: And a few days ago the review was completely removed from the store page.

Pros- +Great looking art style with visual storytelling that I never really expected. There were so many moments where I sat for a second like, hey that's actually really smart, mainly in regards to having conversations and such +Beautiful OST +Coming of age/relationship based story that I'm sure 99% of people can relate to. The story and pacing is really good, despite there being few words explicitly spoken through the whole gameCons--The game is rather short, which in an of itself isn't a big issue, I just wish we got to experience more of this story! It's difficult to say anything bad about this game, it's a short story-rich experience that can get you feeling all sorts of emotions. If that's your thing, you'll probably dig it!  Rating: 3.5/5 
Kosmozuikis	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kosmozuikis/	Sometimes simplicity is all you need, no words, no fancy graphics, just beautiful art to deliver a powerful messageFlorence is a very short interactive story of a girl and some stages of her life. It's simple, lasts only for about and hour but has a huge impact on you.The idea along with the artstyle is really neat. The whole gameplay is just scrolling through images sometimes doing simple tasks. But those tasks usually have a deeper meaning. There are some moving scenes, again with a meaning.It's a very heartwarming and maybe a little heartbreaking story but so is life. A lot of people will see themselves in this game, same stuff many people go through in their life.Sometimes you need a little push to go on. You make memories, you reminisce about the past, think about how life has changed and how you changed. Falling in love, getting to know that person which at first might seem difficult. Big hurtful words you say without thinking. All the hardships and joyful moments of your life.  But you need to remember even if everything falls down you can start painting your world with colors again. It's all there, represented through simple yet beautiful art. Puzzles (this part completely got me), coloring, walking, it's beautiful. I don't know what it is, but this game has something which triggers emotions and makes you think, maybe go to your partner and hug him/her, tell your mother you love her.Graphically it's very minimalistic but beautifully drawn. Not a lot to talk about graphics.No ultrawide for obvious reasons. Performance? No need to talk about it, if your PC can show pictures it will run this game.Music is really nice and it reflects the emotions your going through but I wish there would be a better transition when music changes.Get this if you appreciate art and interactive stories. The game is great but it's very short, sure it's only 5€ but i'd still suggest waiting for a sale. But hey at least it's not 20€ like Gone Home (loved it too btw, but the price...).ProsBeautiful artGood musicYour life on a plateConsCould be a little longerFollow my curator page for more 
EliteSpartanKiller906	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198346841484/	 Too much for too little? The game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it.  What's inside? Story is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling.  Conclusion I highly recommend this game for anyone with feeeels and without. It's short, but as they say it "packs a punch".

Kosmozuikis	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kosmozuikis/	Sometimes simplicity is all you need, no words, no fancy graphics, just beautiful art to deliver a powerful messageFlorence is a very short interactive story of a girl and some stages of her life. It's simple, lasts only for about and hour but has a huge impact on you.The idea along with the artstyle is really neat. The whole gameplay is just scrolling through images sometimes doing simple tasks. But those tasks usually have a deeper meaning. There are some moving scenes, again with a meaning.It's a very heartwarming and maybe a little heartbreaking story but so is life. A lot of people will see themselves in this game, same stuff many people go through in their life.Sometimes you need a little push to go on. You make memories, you reminisce about the past, think about how life has changed and how you changed. Falling in love, getting to know that person which at first might seem difficult. Big hurtful words you say without thinking. All the hardships and joyful moments of your life.  But you need to remember even if everything falls down you can start painting your world with colors again. It's all there, represented through simple yet beautiful art. Puzzles (this part completely got me), coloring, walking, it's beautiful. I don't know what it is, but this game has something which triggers emotions and makes you think, maybe go to your partner and hug him/her, tell your mother you love her.Graphically it's very minimalistic but beautifully drawn. Not a lot to talk about graphics.No ultrawide for obvious reasons. Performance? No need to talk about it, if your PC can show pictures it will run this game.Music is really nice and it reflects the emotions your going through but I wish there would be a better transition when music changes.Get this if you appreciate art and interactive stories. The game is great but it's very short, sure it's only 5€ but i'd still suggest waiting for a sale.

The game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it.  What's inside? Story is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling.

People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.It paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that "routine" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.I liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters.

Bō / Toni	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055802307/	- Act I - Crush What to do on your sad Valentine's day, when you've canceled your own pity party and felt betrayed by your own feelings? Simple. To play the mobile game you've been hearing some good stuff about, which has been given a surprising Steam release. That's how I was introduced to Florence, anyway. I will skip that part of the game winning every possible award and beating all the best mobile games back when it was originally released. You most likely know that already. Besides, it's not that important. The feelings and experience are all that matters. As Maya Angelou famously said: I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. The same is fair for video games - you may forget many details about them, but you will always remember how some of them made you feel. And Florence? Quality emotions delivery service at the click of your mouse!  - Act II - Happy TogetherA wholesome and elegant mix of webcomic, puzzle game, and walking simulator elements will tell you a simple, ordinary even, story about day-to-day routine, escapism, dreams, first love, pain, inspiration, frustration, forgiveness. The story, relevant to many yet somewhat uniquely special for you. It's almost a self-help 'narrative' for your struggling adult life - although, I might have watched too many motivational youtube videos, so let's move on.Gameplay difficulty is at zero level, however, it's still quite enjoyable going through mini-games and being a part of interactive storytelling. Controls are quite simple, but I would recommend using your mouse, as it's more convenient (you will see why), but there's full controller support, if you prefer. Florence is unquestionably linear, but the illusion of choice and different interpretations of your own experience may give you something to ponder about at the end. I say: play it twice. The first time, when you are sad; the second time when you are happy. Test your emotions. Embrace the routine. Improve your St Valentine's Day.- Act III - RoutineOnce you beat the game, you'll have access to all the chapters separately, which is useful, if you want to go through all the achievements. It took me about an hour to complete 30 mins game which felt like a brief moment. I wanted more and I played it again. You know it's good when the time feels faster than it actually is. There are also rumors you can speedrun this game for ~15 mins, but I'm not even sure why I'm telling you this? Music also plays a significant role - it's quite lighthearted, but so on point and will dictate the swings of your mood. The original soundtrack is included, so you can listen to it anytime.- Act IV - The EndIn short: it's when simplicity beats everything. It is a simple yet beautiful experience, and after that short period of time with Florence you may forget the details, but you will remember how this game made you feel. Give it a try. Special thank you to the wonderful Samurai Punk team, who have ported this game to both PC & Switch and made this experience possible!  PS: Thank you all for reading - appreciate your time!

kgsizemo	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198202715070/	My girl does not like crust! ---- SPOILERS!!!! ---- First, let me say that the score for this game is phenomenal! O.k., now that I've addressed that aspect, I will continue with my take on the game's plot.This plot reminds me of one of my favorite movies, La La Land. Although they are technically love stories, both Florence and La La Land have this seemingly tragic element to them. The relationships do not last. This does not mean that the time spent in said relationships were wasted.In Florence's case, both characters were stuck in ruts before they met, just going through the day-to-day motions. Once they met, and eventually began dating, they started to open up and share their thoughts. Their passions. Because they both developed care and affection for each other, they each pushed one another to pursue said passions. If not for Florence, Krish would not have applied for the music academy; If not for Krish, Florence might not have chased her dream of becoming an artist.Both Florence and Krish set one another on a better path than they were on.While Florence and Krish did not end up together, both hugely impacted one another. This is not a sad story. Sometimes people come into your life only for a season... and it can be a beautiful season! Just because the relationship did not last, that does not mean the memories, lessons, or admiration for the other person has to end as well.This game is good. Check it out.

Bodomi	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bodomi/	Florence is an overpriced 30-minute short novel with an un-relatable, and in my opinion horrible story and extremely monotonous 'puzzles'/mini-games that feels like homework for a young child, matching geometrical shapes together and solving math problems like 8+?=16.What I grasp from the moral of story is that: moms are annoying, digital things are bad, anything but homemade cultural meals are negative, a stable relationship with routine is bad, and a good career change in your mid-20's is to start doing something you did as a toddler and never again after that.The art and music is really good but I don't give games positive reviews because they had a wonderful art-style and good soundtrack, unlike most of the people who have given this game a positive review.In the end it sucked. It was boring, the moral of the story was horrible and the last half of the game was just a bunch of fanciful nonsense that would never happen in reality.It's a banal and dull love story. It tries to be deep, but it really isn't.If the game was longer with a lot more detail on how the 2 main characters relationship developed and way more detail on how she continued her sudden artist career it could maybe be a mediocre thing and not a waste of money, but not this 30-minute crap story with a very sudden ending of her deciding to pursue an art career because she drew as a child, like 99% of all children in her shoes did.Curator pageIf you liked this review or otherwise found it helpful in deciding whether or not to buy this game, feel free to follow my Curator page.Edit: All of a sudden my Steam Curator page link is being censored in this review, shows up just fine in all my other reviews.Edit edit: And it's back, after several hours.Edit edit edit: And a few days ago the review was completely removed from the store page.

O.k., now that I've addressed that aspect, I will continue with my take on the game's plot.This plot reminds me of one of my favorite movies, La La Land. Although they are technically love stories, both Florence and La La Land have this seemingly tragic element to them. The relationships do not last. This does not mean that the time spent in said relationships were wasted.In Florence's case, both characters were stuck in ruts before they met, just going through the day-to-day motions. Once they met, and eventually began dating, they started to open up and share their thoughts. Their passions. Because they both developed care and affection for each other, they each pushed one another to pursue said passions. If not for Florence, Krish would not have applied for the music academy; If not for Krish, Florence might not have chased her dream of becoming an artist.Both Florence and Krish set one another on a better path than they were on.While Florence and Krish did not end up together, both hugely impacted one another. This is not a sad story. Sometimes people come into your life only for a season... and it can be a beautiful season!

Bodomi	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bodomi/	Florence is an overpriced 30-minute short novel with an un-relatable, and in my opinion horrible story and extremely monotonous 'puzzles'/mini-games that feels like homework for a young child, matching geometrical shapes together and solving math problems like 8+?=16.What I grasp from the moral of story is that: moms are annoying, digital things are bad, anything but homemade cultural meals are negative, a stable relationship with routine is bad, and a good career change in your mid-20's is to start doing something you did as a toddler and never again after that.The art and music is really good but I don't give games positive reviews because they had a wonderful art-style and good soundtrack, unlike most of the people who have given this game a positive review.In the end it sucked. It was boring, the moral of the story was horrible and the last half of the game was just a bunch of fanciful nonsense that would never happen in reality.It's a banal and dull love story. It tries to be deep, but it really isn't.If the game was longer with a lot more detail on how the 2 main characters relationship developed and way more detail on how she continued her sudden artist career it could maybe be a mediocre thing and not a waste of money, but not this 30-minute crap story with a very sudden ending of her deciding to pursue an art career because she drew as a child, like 99% of all children in her shoes did.Curator pageIf you liked this review or otherwise found it helpful in deciding whether or not to buy this game, feel free to follow my Curator page.Edit: All of a sudden my Steam Curator page link is being censored in this review, shows up just fine in all my other reviews.Edit edit: And it's back, after several hours.Edit edit edit: And a few days ago the review was completely removed from the store page.

Kosmozuikis	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kosmozuikis/	Sometimes simplicity is all you need, no words, no fancy graphics, just beautiful art to deliver a powerful messageFlorence is a very short interactive story of a girl and some stages of her life. It's simple, lasts only for about and hour but has a huge impact on you.The idea along with the artstyle is really neat. The whole gameplay is just scrolling through images sometimes doing simple tasks. But those tasks usually have a deeper meaning. There are some moving scenes, again with a meaning.It's a very heartwarming and maybe a little heartbreaking story but so is life. A lot of people will see themselves in this game, same stuff many people go through in their life.Sometimes you need a little push to go on. You make memories, you reminisce about the past, think about how life has changed and how you changed. Falling in love, getting to know that person which at first might seem difficult. Big hurtful words you say without thinking. All the hardships and joyful moments of your life.  But you need to remember even if everything falls down you can start painting your world with colors again. It's all there, represented through simple yet beautiful art. Puzzles (this part completely got me), coloring, walking, it's beautiful. I don't know what it is, but this game has something which triggers emotions and makes you think, maybe go to your partner and hug him/her, tell your mother you love her.Graphically it's very minimalistic but beautifully drawn. Not a lot to talk about graphics.No ultrawide for obvious reasons. Performance? No need to talk about it, if your PC can show pictures it will run this game.Music is really nice and it reflects the emotions your going through but I wish there would be a better transition when music changes.Get this if you appreciate art and interactive stories. The game is great but it's very short, sure it's only 5€ but i'd still suggest waiting for a sale.

EliteSpartanKiller906	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198346841484/	 Too much for too little? The game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it.  What's inside? Story is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling.  Conclusion I highly recommend this game for anyone with feeeels and without. It's short, but as they say it "packs a punch".

i_Go_SpLaT	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/i_Go_SpLaT/	Started strong, ended annoyingly.Moral of the story? People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.It paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that "routine" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.I liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.At least it was short. 
Bō / Toni	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055802307/	- Act I - Crush What to do on your sad Valentine's day, when you've canceled your own pity party and felt betrayed by your own feelings? Simple. To play the mobile game you've been hearing some good stuff about, which has been given a surprising Steam release. That's how I was introduced to Florence, anyway. I will skip that part of the game winning every possible award and beating all the best mobile games back when it was originally released. You most likely know that already. Besides, it's not that important. The feelings and experience are all that matters. As Maya Angelou famously said: I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. The same is fair for video games - you may forget many details about them, but you will always remember how some of them made you feel. And Florence? Quality emotions delivery service at the click of your mouse!  - Act II - Happy TogetherA wholesome and elegant mix of webcomic, puzzle game, and walking simulator elements will tell you a simple, ordinary even, story about day-to-day routine, escapism, dreams, first love, pain, inspiration, frustration, forgiveness. The story, relevant to many yet somewhat uniquely special for you. It's almost a self-help 'narrative' for your struggling adult life - although, I might have watched too many motivational youtube videos, so let's move on.Gameplay difficulty is at zero level, however, it's still quite enjoyable going through mini-games and being a part of interactive storytelling. Controls are quite simple, but I would recommend using your mouse, as it's more convenient (you will see why), but there's full controller support, if you prefer. Florence is unquestionably linear, but the illusion of choice and different interpretations of your own experience may give you something to ponder about at the end. I say: play it twice. The first time, when you are sad; the second time when you are happy. Test your emotions. Embrace the routine. Improve your St Valentine's Day.- Act III - RoutineOnce you beat the game, you'll have access to all the chapters separately, which is useful, if you want to go through all the achievements. It took me about an hour to complete 30 mins game which felt like a brief moment. I wanted more and I played it again. You know it's good when the time feels faster than it actually is. There are also rumors you can speedrun this game for ~15 mins, but I'm not even sure why I'm telling you this? Music also plays a significant role - it's quite lighthearted, but so on point and will dictate the swings of your mood. The original soundtrack is included, so you can listen to it anytime.- Act IV - The EndIn short: it's when simplicity beats everything. It is a simple yet beautiful experience, and after that short period of time with Florence you may forget the details, but you will remember how this game made you feel. Give it a try. Special thank you to the wonderful Samurai Punk team, who have ported this game to both PC & Switch and made this experience possible!  PS: Thank you all for reading - appreciate your time!

People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.It paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that "routine" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.I liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.At least it was short. 
Bō / Toni	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055802307/	- Act I - Crush What to do on your sad Valentine's day, when you've canceled your own pity party and felt betrayed by your own feelings? Simple. To play the mobile game you've been hearing some good stuff about, which has been given a surprising Steam release. That's how I was introduced to Florence, anyway. I will skip that part of the game winning every possible award and beating all the best mobile games back when it was originally released. You most likely know that already. Besides, it's not that important. The feelings and experience are all that matters. As Maya Angelou famously said: I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. The same is fair for video games - you may forget many details about them, but you will always remember how some of them made you feel. And Florence? Quality emotions delivery service at the click of your mouse!  - Act II - Happy TogetherA wholesome and elegant mix of webcomic, puzzle game, and walking simulator elements will tell you a simple, ordinary even, story about day-to-day routine, escapism, dreams, first love, pain, inspiration, frustration, forgiveness. The story, relevant to many yet somewhat uniquely special for you. It's almost a self-help 'narrative' for your struggling adult life - although, I might have watched too many motivational youtube videos, so let's move on.Gameplay difficulty is at zero level, however, it's still quite enjoyable going through mini-games and being a part of interactive storytelling. Controls are quite simple, but I would recommend using your mouse, as it's more convenient (you will see why), but there's full controller support, if you prefer. Florence is unquestionably linear, but the illusion of choice and different interpretations of your own experience may give you something to ponder about at the end. I say: play it twice. The first time, when you are sad; the second time when you are happy. Test your emotions. Embrace the routine. Improve your St Valentine's Day.- Act III - RoutineOnce you beat the game, you'll have access to all the chapters separately, which is useful, if you want to go through all the achievements. It took me about an hour to complete 30 mins game which felt like a brief moment. I wanted more and I played it again. You know it's good when the time feels faster than it actually is. There are also rumors you can speedrun this game for ~15 mins, but I'm not even sure why I'm telling you this? Music also plays a significant role - it's quite lighthearted, but so on point and will dictate the swings of your mood. The original soundtrack is included, so you can listen to it anytime.- Act IV - The EndIn short: it's when simplicity beats everything. It is a simple yet beautiful experience, and after that short period of time with Florence you may forget the details, but you will remember how this game made you feel. Give it a try. Special thank you to the wonderful Samurai Punk team, who have ported this game to both PC & Switch and made this experience possible!  PS: Thank you all for reading - appreciate your time! Much love ~

O.k., now that I've addressed that aspect, I will continue with my take on the game's plot.This plot reminds me of one of my favorite movies, La La Land. Although they are technically love stories, both Florence and La La Land have this seemingly tragic element to them. The relationships do not last. This does not mean that the time spent in said relationships were wasted.In Florence's case, both characters were stuck in ruts before they met, just going through the day-to-day motions. Once they met, and eventually began dating, they started to open up and share their thoughts. Their passions. Because they both developed care and affection for each other, they each pushed one another to pursue said passions. If not for Florence, Krish would not have applied for the music academy; If not for Krish, Florence might not have chased her dream of becoming an artist.Both Florence and Krish set one another on a better path than they were on.While Florence and Krish did not end up together, both hugely impacted one another. This is not a sad story. Sometimes people come into your life only for a season... and it can be a beautiful season! Just because the relationship did not last, that does not mean the memories, lessons, or admiration for the other person has to end as well.This game is good. Check it out.

Bodomi	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bodomi/	Florence is an overpriced 30-minute short novel with an un-relatable, and in my opinion horrible story and extremely monotonous 'puzzles'/mini-games that feels like homework for a young child, matching geometrical shapes together and solving math problems like 8+?=16.What I grasp from the moral of story is that: moms are annoying, digital things are bad, anything but homemade cultural meals are negative, a stable relationship with routine is bad, and a good career change in your mid-20's is to start doing something you did as a toddler and never again after that.The art and music is really good but I don't give games positive reviews because they had a wonderful art-style and good soundtrack, unlike most of the people who have given this game a positive review.In the end it sucked. It was boring, the moral of the story was horrible and the last half of the game was just a bunch of fanciful nonsense that would never happen in reality.It's a banal and dull love story. It tries to be deep, but it really isn't.If the game was longer with a lot more detail on how the 2 main characters relationship developed and way more detail on how she continued her sudden artist career it could maybe be a mediocre thing and not a waste of money, but not this 30-minute crap story with a very sudden ending of her deciding to pursue an art career because she drew as a child, like 99% of all children in her shoes did.Curator pageIf you liked this review or otherwise found it helpful in deciding whether or not to buy this game, feel free to follow my Curator page.Edit: All of a sudden my Steam Curator page link is being censored in this review, shows up just fine in all my other reviews.Edit edit: And it's back, after several hours.Edit edit edit: And a few days ago the review was completely removed from the store page.

Pros- +Great looking art style with visual storytelling that I never really expected. There were so many moments where I sat for a second like, hey that's actually really smart, mainly in regards to having conversations and such +Beautiful OST +Coming of age/relationship based story that I'm sure 99% of people can relate to. The story and pacing is really good, despite there being few words explicitly spoken through the whole gameCons--The game is rather short, which in an of itself isn't a big issue, I just wish we got to experience more of this story! It's difficult to say anything bad about this game, it's a short story-rich experience that can get you feeling all sorts of emotions. If that's your thing, you'll probably dig it!  Rating: 3.5/5 
Kosmozuikis	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kosmozuikis/	Sometimes simplicity is all you need, no words, no fancy graphics, just beautiful art to deliver a powerful messageFlorence is a very short interactive story of a girl and some stages of her life. It's simple, lasts only for about and hour but has a huge impact on you.The idea along with the artstyle is really neat. The whole gameplay is just scrolling through images sometimes doing simple tasks. But those tasks usually have a deeper meaning. There are some moving scenes, again with a meaning.It's a very heartwarming and maybe a little heartbreaking story but so is life. A lot of people will see themselves in this game, same stuff many people go through in their life.Sometimes you need a little push to go on. You make memories, you reminisce about the past, think about how life has changed and how you changed. Falling in love, getting to know that person which at first might seem difficult. Big hurtful words you say without thinking. All the hardships and joyful moments of your life.  But you need to remember even if everything falls down you can start painting your world with colors again. It's all there, represented through simple yet beautiful art. Puzzles (this part completely got me), coloring, walking, it's beautiful. I don't know what it is, but this game has something which triggers emotions and makes you think, maybe go to your partner and hug him/her, tell your mother you love her.Graphically it's very minimalistic but beautifully drawn. Not a lot to talk about graphics.No ultrawide for obvious reasons. Performance? No need to talk about it, if your PC can show pictures it will run this game.Music is really nice and it reflects the emotions your going through but I wish there would be a better transition when music changes.Get this if you appreciate art and interactive stories. The game is great but it's very short, sure it's only 5€ but i'd still suggest waiting for a sale. But hey at least it's not 20€ like Gone Home (loved it too btw, but the price...).ProsBeautiful artGood musicYour life on a plateConsCould be a little longerFollow my curator page for more 
EliteSpartanKiller906	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198346841484/	 Too much for too little? The game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it.  What's inside? Story is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling.  Conclusion I highly recommend this game for anyone with feeeels and without. It's short, but as they say it "packs a punch".

Kosmozuikis	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kosmozuikis/	Sometimes simplicity is all you need, no words, no fancy graphics, just beautiful art to deliver a powerful messageFlorence is a very short interactive story of a girl and some stages of her life. It's simple, lasts only for about and hour but has a huge impact on you.The idea along with the artstyle is really neat. The whole gameplay is just scrolling through images sometimes doing simple tasks. But those tasks usually have a deeper meaning. There are some moving scenes, again with a meaning.It's a very heartwarming and maybe a little heartbreaking story but so is life. A lot of people will see themselves in this game, same stuff many people go through in their life.Sometimes you need a little push to go on. You make memories, you reminisce about the past, think about how life has changed and how you changed. Falling in love, getting to know that person which at first might seem difficult. Big hurtful words you say without thinking. All the hardships and joyful moments of your life.  But you need to remember even if everything falls down you can start painting your world with colors again. It's all there, represented through simple yet beautiful art. Puzzles (this part completely got me), coloring, walking, it's beautiful. I don't know what it is, but this game has something which triggers emotions and makes you think, maybe go to your partner and hug him/her, tell your mother you love her.Graphically it's very minimalistic but beautifully drawn. Not a lot to talk about graphics.No ultrawide for obvious reasons. Performance? No need to talk about it, if your PC can show pictures it will run this game.Music is really nice and it reflects the emotions your going through but I wish there would be a better transition when music changes.Get this if you appreciate art and interactive stories. The game is great but it's very short, sure it's only 5€ but i'd still suggest waiting for a sale.

The game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it.  What's inside? Story is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling.

People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.It paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that "routine" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.I liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters.

Bō / Toni	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055802307/	- Act I - Crush What to do on your sad Valentine's day, when you've canceled your own pity party and felt betrayed by your own feelings? Simple. To play the mobile game you've been hearing some good stuff about, which has been given a surprising Steam release. That's how I was introduced to Florence, anyway. I will skip that part of the game winning every possible award and beating all the best mobile games back when it was originally released. You most likely know that already. Besides, it's not that important. The feelings and experience are all that matters. As Maya Angelou famously said: I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. The same is fair for video games - you may forget many details about them, but you will always remember how some of them made you feel. And Florence? Quality emotions delivery service at the click of your mouse!  - Act II - Happy TogetherA wholesome and elegant mix of webcomic, puzzle game, and walking simulator elements will tell you a simple, ordinary even, story about day-to-day routine, escapism, dreams, first love, pain, inspiration, frustration, forgiveness. The story, relevant to many yet somewhat uniquely special for you. It's almost a self-help 'narrative' for your struggling adult life - although, I might have watched too many motivational youtube videos, so let's move on.Gameplay difficulty is at zero level, however, it's still quite enjoyable going through mini-games and being a part of interactive storytelling. Controls are quite simple, but I would recommend using your mouse, as it's more convenient (you will see why), but there's full controller support, if you prefer. Florence is unquestionably linear, but the illusion of choice and different interpretations of your own experience may give you something to ponder about at the end. I say: play it twice. The first time, when you are sad; the second time when you are happy. Test your emotions. Embrace the routine. Improve your St Valentine's Day.- Act III - RoutineOnce you beat the game, you'll have access to all the chapters separately, which is useful, if you want to go through all the achievements. It took me about an hour to complete 30 mins game which felt like a brief moment. I wanted more and I played it again. You know it's good when the time feels faster than it actually is. There are also rumors you can speedrun this game for ~15 mins, but I'm not even sure why I'm telling you this? Music also plays a significant role - it's quite lighthearted, but so on point and will dictate the swings of your mood. The original soundtrack is included, so you can listen to it anytime.- Act IV - The EndIn short: it's when simplicity beats everything. It is a simple yet beautiful experience, and after that short period of time with Florence you may forget the details, but you will remember how this game made you feel. Give it a try. Special thank you to the wonderful Samurai Punk team, who have ported this game to both PC & Switch and made this experience possible!  PS: Thank you all for reading - appreciate your time!

kgsizemo	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198202715070/	My girl does not like crust! ---- SPOILERS!!!! ---- First, let me say that the score for this game is phenomenal! O.k., now that I've addressed that aspect, I will continue with my take on the game's plot.This plot reminds me of one of my favorite movies, La La Land. Although they are technically love stories, both Florence and La La Land have this seemingly tragic element to them. The relationships do not last. This does not mean that the time spent in said relationships were wasted.In Florence's case, both characters were stuck in ruts before they met, just going through the day-to-day motions. Once they met, and eventually began dating, they started to open up and share their thoughts. Their passions. Because they both developed care and affection for each other, they each pushed one another to pursue said passions. If not for Florence, Krish would not have applied for the music academy; If not for Krish, Florence might not have chased her dream of becoming an artist.Both Florence and Krish set one another on a better path than they were on.While Florence and Krish did not end up together, both hugely impacted one another. This is not a sad story. Sometimes people come into your life only for a season... and it can be a beautiful season! Just because the relationship did not last, that does not mean the memories, lessons, or admiration for the other person has to end as well.This game is good. Check it out.

Bodomi	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bodomi/	Florence is an overpriced 30-minute short novel with an un-relatable, and in my opinion horrible story and extremely monotonous 'puzzles'/mini-games that feels like homework for a young child, matching geometrical shapes together and solving math problems like 8+?=16.What I grasp from the moral of story is that: moms are annoying, digital things are bad, anything but homemade cultural meals are negative, a stable relationship with routine is bad, and a good career change in your mid-20's is to start doing something you did as a toddler and never again after that.The art and music is really good but I don't give games positive reviews because they had a wonderful art-style and good soundtrack, unlike most of the people who have given this game a positive review.In the end it sucked. It was boring, the moral of the story was horrible and the last half of the game was just a bunch of fanciful nonsense that would never happen in reality.It's a banal and dull love story. It tries to be deep, but it really isn't.If the game was longer with a lot more detail on how the 2 main characters relationship developed and way more detail on how she continued her sudden artist career it could maybe be a mediocre thing and not a waste of money, but not this 30-minute crap story with a very sudden ending of her deciding to pursue an art career because she drew as a child, like 99% of all children in her shoes did.Curator pageIf you liked this review or otherwise found it helpful in deciding whether or not to buy this game, feel free to follow my Curator page.Edit: All of a sudden my Steam Curator page link is being censored in this review, shows up just fine in all my other reviews.Edit edit: And it's back, after several hours.Edit edit edit: And a few days ago the review was completely removed from the store page.

O.k., now that I've addressed that aspect, I will continue with my take on the game's plot.This plot reminds me of one of my favorite movies, La La Land. Although they are technically love stories, both Florence and La La Land have this seemingly tragic element to them. The relationships do not last. This does not mean that the time spent in said relationships were wasted.In Florence's case, both characters were stuck in ruts before they met, just going through the day-to-day motions. Once they met, and eventually began dating, they started to open up and share their thoughts. Their passions. Because they both developed care and affection for each other, they each pushed one another to pursue said passions. If not for Florence, Krish would not have applied for the music academy; If not for Krish, Florence might not have chased her dream of becoming an artist.Both Florence and Krish set one another on a better path than they were on.While Florence and Krish did not end up together, both hugely impacted one another. This is not a sad story. Sometimes people come into your life only for a season... and it can be a beautiful season!

Bodomi	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bodomi/	Florence is an overpriced 30-minute short novel with an un-relatable, and in my opinion horrible story and extremely monotonous 'puzzles'/mini-games that feels like homework for a young child, matching geometrical shapes together and solving math problems like 8+?=16.What I grasp from the moral of story is that: moms are annoying, digital things are bad, anything but homemade cultural meals are negative, a stable relationship with routine is bad, and a good career change in your mid-20's is to start doing something you did as a toddler and never again after that.The art and music is really good but I don't give games positive reviews because they had a wonderful art-style and good soundtrack, unlike most of the people who have given this game a positive review.In the end it sucked. It was boring, the moral of the story was horrible and the last half of the game was just a bunch of fanciful nonsense that would never happen in reality.It's a banal and dull love story. It tries to be deep, but it really isn't.If the game was longer with a lot more detail on how the 2 main characters relationship developed and way more detail on how she continued her sudden artist career it could maybe be a mediocre thing and not a waste of money, but not this 30-minute crap story with a very sudden ending of her deciding to pursue an art career because she drew as a child, like 99% of all children in her shoes did.Curator pageIf you liked this review or otherwise found it helpful in deciding whether or not to buy this game, feel free to follow my Curator page.Edit: All of a sudden my Steam Curator page link is being censored in this review, shows up just fine in all my other reviews.Edit edit: And it's back, after several hours.Edit edit edit: And a few days ago the review was completely removed from the store page.

Kosmozuikis	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kosmozuikis/	Sometimes simplicity is all you need, no words, no fancy graphics, just beautiful art to deliver a powerful messageFlorence is a very short interactive story of a girl and some stages of her life. It's simple, lasts only for about and hour but has a huge impact on you.The idea along with the artstyle is really neat. The whole gameplay is just scrolling through images sometimes doing simple tasks. But those tasks usually have a deeper meaning. There are some moving scenes, again with a meaning.It's a very heartwarming and maybe a little heartbreaking story but so is life. A lot of people will see themselves in this game, same stuff many people go through in their life.Sometimes you need a little push to go on. You make memories, you reminisce about the past, think about how life has changed and how you changed. Falling in love, getting to know that person which at first might seem difficult. Big hurtful words you say without thinking. All the hardships and joyful moments of your life.  But you need to remember even if everything falls down you can start painting your world with colors again. It's all there, represented through simple yet beautiful art. Puzzles (this part completely got me), coloring, walking, it's beautiful. I don't know what it is, but this game has something which triggers emotions and makes you think, maybe go to your partner and hug him/her, tell your mother you love her.Graphically it's very minimalistic but beautifully drawn. Not a lot to talk about graphics.No ultrawide for obvious reasons. Performance? No need to talk about it, if your PC can show pictures it will run this game.Music is really nice and it reflects the emotions your going through but I wish there would be a better transition when music changes.Get this if you appreciate art and interactive stories. The game is great but it's very short, sure it's only 5€ but i'd still suggest waiting for a sale.

EliteSpartanKiller906	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198346841484/	 Too much for too little? The game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it.  What's inside? Story is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling.  Conclusion I highly recommend this game for anyone with feeeels and without. It's short, but as they say it "packs a punch".

i_Go_SpLaT	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/i_Go_SpLaT/	Started strong, ended annoyingly.Moral of the story? People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.It paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that "routine" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.I liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.At least it was short. 
Bō / Toni	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055802307/	- Act I - Crush What to do on your sad Valentine's day, when you've canceled your own pity party and felt betrayed by your own feelings? Simple. To play the mobile game you've been hearing some good stuff about, which has been given a surprising Steam release. That's how I was introduced to Florence, anyway. I will skip that part of the game winning every possible award and beating all the best mobile games back when it was originally released. You most likely know that already. Besides, it's not that important. The feelings and experience are all that matters. As Maya Angelou famously said: I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. The same is fair for video games - you may forget many details about them, but you will always remember how some of them made you feel. And Florence? Quality emotions delivery service at the click of your mouse!  - Act II - Happy TogetherA wholesome and elegant mix of webcomic, puzzle game, and walking simulator elements will tell you a simple, ordinary even, story about day-to-day routine, escapism, dreams, first love, pain, inspiration, frustration, forgiveness. The story, relevant to many yet somewhat uniquely special for you. It's almost a self-help 'narrative' for your struggling adult life - although, I might have watched too many motivational youtube videos, so let's move on.Gameplay difficulty is at zero level, however, it's still quite enjoyable going through mini-games and being a part of interactive storytelling. Controls are quite simple, but I would recommend using your mouse, as it's more convenient (you will see why), but there's full controller support, if you prefer. Florence is unquestionably linear, but the illusion of choice and different interpretations of your own experience may give you something to ponder about at the end. I say: play it twice. The first time, when you are sad; the second time when you are happy. Test your emotions. Embrace the routine. Improve your St Valentine's Day.- Act III - RoutineOnce you beat the game, you'll have access to all the chapters separately, which is useful, if you want to go through all the achievements. It took me about an hour to complete 30 mins game which felt like a brief moment. I wanted more and I played it again. You know it's good when the time feels faster than it actually is. There are also rumors you can speedrun this game for ~15 mins, but I'm not even sure why I'm telling you this? Music also plays a significant role - it's quite lighthearted, but so on point and will dictate the swings of your mood. The original soundtrack is included, so you can listen to it anytime.- Act IV - The EndIn short: it's when simplicity beats everything. It is a simple yet beautiful experience, and after that short period of time with Florence you may forget the details, but you will remember how this game made you feel. Give it a try. Special thank you to the wonderful Samurai Punk team, who have ported this game to both PC & Switch and made this experience possible!  PS: Thank you all for reading - appreciate your time!

People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.It paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that "routine" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.I liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.At least it was short. 
Bō / Toni	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055802307/	- Act I - Crush What to do on your sad Valentine's day, when you've canceled your own pity party and felt betrayed by your own feelings? Simple. To play the mobile game you've been hearing some good stuff about, which has been given a surprising Steam release. That's how I was introduced to Florence, anyway. I will skip that part of the game winning every possible award and beating all the best mobile games back when it was originally released. You most likely know that already. Besides, it's not that important. The feelings and experience are all that matters. As Maya Angelou famously said: I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. The same is fair for video games - you may forget many details about them, but you will always remember how some of them made you feel. And Florence? Quality emotions delivery service at the click of your mouse!  - Act II - Happy TogetherA wholesome and elegant mix of webcomic, puzzle game, and walking simulator elements will tell you a simple, ordinary even, story about day-to-day routine, escapism, dreams, first love, pain, inspiration, frustration, forgiveness. The story, relevant to many yet somewhat uniquely special for you. It's almost a self-help 'narrative' for your struggling adult life - although, I might have watched too many motivational youtube videos, so let's move on.Gameplay difficulty is at zero level, however, it's still quite enjoyable going through mini-games and being a part of interactive storytelling. Controls are quite simple, but I would recommend using your mouse, as it's more convenient (you will see why), but there's full controller support, if you prefer. Florence is unquestionably linear, but the illusion of choice and different interpretations of your own experience may give you something to ponder about at the end. I say: play it twice. The first time, when you are sad; the second time when you are happy. Test your emotions. Embrace the routine. Improve your St Valentine's Day.- Act III - RoutineOnce you beat the game, you'll have access to all the chapters separately, which is useful, if you want to go through all the achievements. It took me about an hour to complete 30 mins game which felt like a brief moment. I wanted more and I played it again. You know it's good when the time feels faster than it actually is. There are also rumors you can speedrun this game for ~15 mins, but I'm not even sure why I'm telling you this? Music also plays a significant role - it's quite lighthearted, but so on point and will dictate the swings of your mood. The original soundtrack is included, so you can listen to it anytime.- Act IV - The EndIn short: it's when simplicity beats everything. It is a simple yet beautiful experience, and after that short period of time with Florence you may forget the details, but you will remember how this game made you feel. Give it a try. Special thank you to the wonderful Samurai Punk team, who have ported this game to both PC & Switch and made this experience possible!  PS: Thank you all for reading - appreciate your time! Much love ~

O.k., now that I've addressed that aspect, I will continue with my take on the game's plot.This plot reminds me of one of my favorite movies, La La Land. Although they are technically love stories, both Florence and La La Land have this seemingly tragic element to them. The relationships do not last. This does not mean that the time spent in said relationships were wasted.In Florence's case, both characters were stuck in ruts before they met, just going through the day-to-day motions. Once they met, and eventually began dating, they started to open up and share their thoughts. Their passions. Because they both developed care and affection for each other, they each pushed one another to pursue said passions. If not for Florence, Krish would not have applied for the music academy; If not for Krish, Florence might not have chased her dream of becoming an artist.Both Florence and Krish set one another on a better path than they were on.While Florence and Krish did not end up together, both hugely impacted one another. This is not a sad story. Sometimes people come into your life only for a season... and it can be a beautiful season! Just because the relationship did not last, that does not mean the memories, lessons, or admiration for the other person has to end as well.This game is good. Check it out.

Bodomi	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bodomi/	Florence is an overpriced 30-minute short novel with an un-relatable, and in my opinion horrible story and extremely monotonous 'puzzles'/mini-games that feels like homework for a young child, matching geometrical shapes together and solving math problems like 8+?=16.What I grasp from the moral of story is that: moms are annoying, digital things are bad, anything but homemade cultural meals are negative, a stable relationship with routine is bad, and a good career change in your mid-20's is to start doing something you did as a toddler and never again after that.The art and music is really good but I don't give games positive reviews because they had a wonderful art-style and good soundtrack, unlike most of the people who have given this game a positive review.In the end it sucked. It was boring, the moral of the story was horrible and the last half of the game was just a bunch of fanciful nonsense that would never happen in reality.It's a banal and dull love story. It tries to be deep, but it really isn't.If the game was longer with a lot more detail on how the 2 main characters relationship developed and way more detail on how she continued her sudden artist career it could maybe be a mediocre thing and not a waste of money, but not this 30-minute crap story with a very sudden ending of her deciding to pursue an art career because she drew as a child, like 99% of all children in her shoes did.Curator pageIf you liked this review or otherwise found it helpful in deciding whether or not to buy this game, feel free to follow my Curator page.Edit: All of a sudden my Steam Curator page link is being censored in this review, shows up just fine in all my other reviews.Edit edit: And it's back, after several hours.Edit edit edit: And a few days ago the review was completely removed from the store page.

Pros- +Great looking art style with visual storytelling that I never really expected. There were so many moments where I sat for a second like, hey that's actually really smart, mainly in regards to having conversations and such +Beautiful OST +Coming of age/relationship based story that I'm sure 99% of people can relate to. The story and pacing is really good, despite there being few words explicitly spoken through the whole gameCons--The game is rather short, which in an of itself isn't a big issue, I just wish we got to experience more of this story! It's difficult to say anything bad about this game, it's a short story-rich experience that can get you feeling all sorts of emotions. If that's your thing, you'll probably dig it!  Rating: 3.5/5 
Kosmozuikis	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kosmozuikis/	Sometimes simplicity is all you need, no words, no fancy graphics, just beautiful art to deliver a powerful messageFlorence is a very short interactive story of a girl and some stages of her life. It's simple, lasts only for about and hour but has a huge impact on you.The idea along with the artstyle is really neat. The whole gameplay is just scrolling through images sometimes doing simple tasks. But those tasks usually have a deeper meaning. There are some moving scenes, again with a meaning.It's a very heartwarming and maybe a little heartbreaking story but so is life. A lot of people will see themselves in this game, same stuff many people go through in their life.Sometimes you need a little push to go on. You make memories, you reminisce about the past, think about how life has changed and how you changed. Falling in love, getting to know that person which at first might seem difficult. Big hurtful words you say without thinking. All the hardships and joyful moments of your life.  But you need to remember even if everything falls down you can start painting your world with colors again. It's all there, represented through simple yet beautiful art. Puzzles (this part completely got me), coloring, walking, it's beautiful. I don't know what it is, but this game has something which triggers emotions and makes you think, maybe go to your partner and hug him/her, tell your mother you love her.Graphically it's very minimalistic but beautifully drawn. Not a lot to talk about graphics.No ultrawide for obvious reasons. Performance? No need to talk about it, if your PC can show pictures it will run this game.Music is really nice and it reflects the emotions your going through but I wish there would be a better transition when music changes.Get this if you appreciate art and interactive stories. The game is great but it's very short, sure it's only 5€ but i'd still suggest waiting for a sale. But hey at least it's not 20€ like Gone Home (loved it too btw, but the price...).ProsBeautiful artGood musicYour life on a plateConsCould be a little longerFollow my curator page for more 
EliteSpartanKiller906	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198346841484/	 Too much for too little? The game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it.  What's inside? Story is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling.  Conclusion I highly recommend this game for anyone with feeeels and without. It's short, but as they say it "packs a punch".

Kosmozuikis	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kosmozuikis/	Sometimes simplicity is all you need, no words, no fancy graphics, just beautiful art to deliver a powerful messageFlorence is a very short interactive story of a girl and some stages of her life. It's simple, lasts only for about and hour but has a huge impact on you.The idea along with the artstyle is really neat. The whole gameplay is just scrolling through images sometimes doing simple tasks. But those tasks usually have a deeper meaning. There are some moving scenes, again with a meaning.It's a very heartwarming and maybe a little heartbreaking story but so is life. A lot of people will see themselves in this game, same stuff many people go through in their life.Sometimes you need a little push to go on. You make memories, you reminisce about the past, think about how life has changed and how you changed. Falling in love, getting to know that person which at first might seem difficult. Big hurtful words you say without thinking. All the hardships and joyful moments of your life.  But you need to remember even if everything falls down you can start painting your world with colors again. It's all there, represented through simple yet beautiful art. Puzzles (this part completely got me), coloring, walking, it's beautiful. I don't know what it is, but this game has something which triggers emotions and makes you think, maybe go to your partner and hug him/her, tell your mother you love her.Graphically it's very minimalistic but beautifully drawn. Not a lot to talk about graphics.No ultrawide for obvious reasons. Performance? No need to talk about it, if your PC can show pictures it will run this game.Music is really nice and it reflects the emotions your going through but I wish there would be a better transition when music changes.Get this if you appreciate art and interactive stories. The game is great but it's very short, sure it's only 5€ but i'd still suggest waiting for a sale.

The game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it.  What's inside? Story is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling.

People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.It paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that "routine" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.I liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters.

Bō / Toni	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055802307/	- Act I - Crush What to do on your sad Valentine's day, when you've canceled your own pity party and felt betrayed by your own feelings? Simple. To play the mobile game you've been hearing some good stuff about, which has been given a surprising Steam release. That's how I was introduced to Florence, anyway. I will skip that part of the game winning every possible award and beating all the best mobile games back when it was originally released. You most likely know that already. Besides, it's not that important. The feelings and experience are all that matters. As Maya Angelou famously said: I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. The same is fair for video games - you may forget many details about them, but you will always remember how some of them made you feel. And Florence? Quality emotions delivery service at the click of your mouse!  - Act II - Happy TogetherA wholesome and elegant mix of webcomic, puzzle game, and walking simulator elements will tell you a simple, ordinary even, story about day-to-day routine, escapism, dreams, first love, pain, inspiration, frustration, forgiveness. The story, relevant to many yet somewhat uniquely special for you. It's almost a self-help 'narrative' for your struggling adult life - although, I might have watched too many motivational youtube videos, so let's move on.Gameplay difficulty is at zero level, however, it's still quite enjoyable going through mini-games and being a part of interactive storytelling. Controls are quite simple, but I would recommend using your mouse, as it's more convenient (you will see why), but there's full controller support, if you prefer. Florence is unquestionably linear, but the illusion of choice and different interpretations of your own experience may give you something to ponder about at the end. I say: play it twice. The first time, when you are sad; the second time when you are happy. Test your emotions. Embrace the routine. Improve your St Valentine's Day.- Act III - RoutineOnce you beat the game, you'll have access to all the chapters separately, which is useful, if you want to go through all the achievements. It took me about an hour to complete 30 mins game which felt like a brief moment. I wanted more and I played it again. You know it's good when the time feels faster than it actually is. There are also rumors you can speedrun this game for ~15 mins, but I'm not even sure why I'm telling you this? Music also plays a significant role - it's quite lighthearted, but so on point and will dictate the swings of your mood. The original soundtrack is included, so you can listen to it anytime.- Act IV - The EndIn short: it's when simplicity beats everything. It is a simple yet beautiful experience, and after that short period of time with Florence you may forget the details, but you will remember how this game made you feel. Give it a try. Special thank you to the wonderful Samurai Punk team, who have ported this game to both PC & Switch and made this experience possible!  PS: Thank you all for reading - appreciate your time!

kgsizemo	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198202715070/	My girl does not like crust! ---- SPOILERS!!!! ---- First, let me say that the score for this game is phenomenal! O.k., now that I've addressed that aspect, I will continue with my take on the game's plot.This plot reminds me of one of my favorite movies, La La Land. Although they are technically love stories, both Florence and La La Land have this seemingly tragic element to them. The relationships do not last. This does not mean that the time spent in said relationships were wasted.In Florence's case, both characters were stuck in ruts before they met, just going through the day-to-day motions. Once they met, and eventually began dating, they started to open up and share their thoughts. Their passions. Because they both developed care and affection for each other, they each pushed one another to pursue said passions. If not for Florence, Krish would not have applied for the music academy; If not for Krish, Florence might not have chased her dream of becoming an artist.Both Florence and Krish set one another on a better path than they were on.While Florence and Krish did not end up together, both hugely impacted one another. This is not a sad story. Sometimes people come into your life only for a season... and it can be a beautiful season! Just because the relationship did not last, that does not mean the memories, lessons, or admiration for the other person has to end as well.This game is good. Check it out.

Bodomi	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bodomi/	Florence is an overpriced 30-minute short novel with an un-relatable, and in my opinion horrible story and extremely monotonous 'puzzles'/mini-games that feels like homework for a young child, matching geometrical shapes together and solving math problems like 8+?=16.What I grasp from the moral of story is that: moms are annoying, digital things are bad, anything but homemade cultural meals are negative, a stable relationship with routine is bad, and a good career change in your mid-20's is to start doing something you did as a toddler and never again after that.The art and music is really good but I don't give games positive reviews because they had a wonderful art-style and good soundtrack, unlike most of the people who have given this game a positive review.In the end it sucked. It was boring, the moral of the story was horrible and the last half of the game was just a bunch of fanciful nonsense that would never happen in reality.It's a banal and dull love story. It tries to be deep, but it really isn't.If the game was longer with a lot more detail on how the 2 main characters relationship developed and way more detail on how she continued her sudden artist career it could maybe be a mediocre thing and not a waste of money, but not this 30-minute crap story with a very sudden ending of her deciding to pursue an art career because she drew as a child, like 99% of all children in her shoes did.Curator pageIf you liked this review or otherwise found it helpful in deciding whether or not to buy this game, feel free to follow my Curator page.Edit: All of a sudden my Steam Curator page link is being censored in this review, shows up just fine in all my other reviews.Edit edit: And it's back, after several hours.Edit edit edit: And a few days ago the review was completely removed from the store page.

O.k., now that I've addressed that aspect, I will continue with my take on the game's plot.This plot reminds me of one of my favorite movies, La La Land. Although they are technically love stories, both Florence and La La Land have this seemingly tragic element to them. The relationships do not last. This does not mean that the time spent in said relationships were wasted.In Florence's case, both characters were stuck in ruts before they met, just going through the day-to-day motions. Once they met, and eventually began dating, they started to open up and share their thoughts. Their passions. Because they both developed care and affection for each other, they each pushed one another to pursue said passions. If not for Florence, Krish would not have applied for the music academy; If not for Krish, Florence might not have chased her dream of becoming an artist.Both Florence and Krish set one another on a better path than they were on.While Florence and Krish did not end up together, both hugely impacted one another. This is not a sad story. Sometimes people come into your life only for a season... and it can be a beautiful season!

Bodomi	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bodomi/	Florence is an overpriced 30-minute short novel with an un-relatable, and in my opinion horrible story and extremely monotonous 'puzzles'/mini-games that feels like homework for a young child, matching geometrical shapes together and solving math problems like 8+?=16.What I grasp from the moral of story is that: moms are annoying, digital things are bad, anything but homemade cultural meals are negative, a stable relationship with routine is bad, and a good career change in your mid-20's is to start doing something you did as a toddler and never again after that.The art and music is really good but I don't give games positive reviews because they had a wonderful art-style and good soundtrack, unlike most of the people who have given this game a positive review.In the end it sucked. It was boring, the moral of the story was horrible and the last half of the game was just a bunch of fanciful nonsense that would never happen in reality.It's a banal and dull love story. It tries to be deep, but it really isn't.If the game was longer with a lot more detail on how the 2 main characters relationship developed and way more detail on how she continued her sudden artist career it could maybe be a mediocre thing and not a waste of money, but not this 30-minute crap story with a very sudden ending of her deciding to pursue an art career because she drew as a child, like 99% of all children in her shoes did.Curator pageIf you liked this review or otherwise found it helpful in deciding whether or not to buy this game, feel free to follow my Curator page.Edit: All of a sudden my Steam Curator page link is being censored in this review, shows up just fine in all my other reviews.Edit edit: And it's back, after several hours.Edit edit edit: And a few days ago the review was completely removed from the store page.

Kosmozuikis	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kosmozuikis/	Sometimes simplicity is all you need, no words, no fancy graphics, just beautiful art to deliver a powerful messageFlorence is a very short interactive story of a girl and some stages of her life. It's simple, lasts only for about and hour but has a huge impact on you.The idea along with the artstyle is really neat. The whole gameplay is just scrolling through images sometimes doing simple tasks. But those tasks usually have a deeper meaning. There are some moving scenes, again with a meaning.It's a very heartwarming and maybe a little heartbreaking story but so is life. A lot of people will see themselves in this game, same stuff many people go through in their life.Sometimes you need a little push to go on. You make memories, you reminisce about the past, think about how life has changed and how you changed. Falling in love, getting to know that person which at first might seem difficult. Big hurtful words you say without thinking. All the hardships and joyful moments of your life.  But you need to remember even if everything falls down you can start painting your world with colors again. It's all there, represented through simple yet beautiful art. Puzzles (this part completely got me), coloring, walking, it's beautiful. I don't know what it is, but this game has something which triggers emotions and makes you think, maybe go to your partner and hug him/her, tell your mother you love her.Graphically it's very minimalistic but beautifully drawn. Not a lot to talk about graphics.No ultrawide for obvious reasons. Performance? No need to talk about it, if your PC can show pictures it will run this game.Music is really nice and it reflects the emotions your going through but I wish there would be a better transition when music changes.Get this if you appreciate art and interactive stories. The game is great but it's very short, sure it's only 5€ but i'd still suggest waiting for a sale.

EliteSpartanKiller906	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198346841484/	 Too much for too little? The game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it.  What's inside? Story is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling.  Conclusion I highly recommend this game for anyone with feeeels and without. It's short, but as they say it "packs a punch".

i_Go_SpLaT	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/i_Go_SpLaT/	Started strong, ended annoyingly.Moral of the story? People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.It paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that "routine" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.I liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.At least it was short. 
Bō / Toni	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055802307/	- Act I - Crush What to do on your sad Valentine's day, when you've canceled your own pity party and felt betrayed by your own feelings? Simple. To play the mobile game you've been hearing some good stuff about, which has been given a surprising Steam release. That's how I was introduced to Florence, anyway. I will skip that part of the game winning every possible award and beating all the best mobile games back when it was originally released. You most likely know that already. Besides, it's not that important. The feelings and experience are all that matters. As Maya Angelou famously said: I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. The same is fair for video games - you may forget many details about them, but you will always remember how some of them made you feel. And Florence? Quality emotions delivery service at the click of your mouse!  - Act II - Happy TogetherA wholesome and elegant mix of webcomic, puzzle game, and walking simulator elements will tell you a simple, ordinary even, story about day-to-day routine, escapism, dreams, first love, pain, inspiration, frustration, forgiveness. The story, relevant to many yet somewhat uniquely special for you. It's almost a self-help 'narrative' for your struggling adult life - although, I might have watched too many motivational youtube videos, so let's move on.Gameplay difficulty is at zero level, however, it's still quite enjoyable going through mini-games and being a part of interactive storytelling. Controls are quite simple, but I would recommend using your mouse, as it's more convenient (you will see why), but there's full controller support, if you prefer. Florence is unquestionably linear, but the illusion of choice and different interpretations of your own experience may give you something to ponder about at the end. I say: play it twice. The first time, when you are sad; the second time when you are happy. Test your emotions. Embrace the routine. Improve your St Valentine's Day.- Act III - RoutineOnce you beat the game, you'll have access to all the chapters separately, which is useful, if you want to go through all the achievements. It took me about an hour to complete 30 mins game which felt like a brief moment. I wanted more and I played it again. You know it's good when the time feels faster than it actually is. There are also rumors you can speedrun this game for ~15 mins, but I'm not even sure why I'm telling you this? Music also plays a significant role - it's quite lighthearted, but so on point and will dictate the swings of your mood. The original soundtrack is included, so you can listen to it anytime.- Act IV - The EndIn short: it's when simplicity beats everything. It is a simple yet beautiful experience, and after that short period of time with Florence you may forget the details, but you will remember how this game made you feel. Give it a try. Special thank you to the wonderful Samurai Punk team, who have ported this game to both PC & Switch and made this experience possible!  PS: Thank you all for reading - appreciate your time!

People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.It paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that "routine" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.I liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.At least it was short. 
Bō / Toni	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055802307/	- Act I - Crush What to do on your sad Valentine's day, when you've canceled your own pity party and felt betrayed by your own feelings? Simple. To play the mobile game you've been hearing some good stuff about, which has been given a surprising Steam release. That's how I was introduced to Florence, anyway. I will skip that part of the game winning every possible award and beating all the best mobile games back when it was originally released. You most likely know that already. Besides, it's not that important. The feelings and experience are all that matters. As Maya Angelou famously said: I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. The same is fair for video games - you may forget many details about them, but you will always remember how some of them made you feel. And Florence? Quality emotions delivery service at the click of your mouse!  - Act II - Happy TogetherA wholesome and elegant mix of webcomic, puzzle game, and walking simulator elements will tell you a simple, ordinary even, story about day-to-day routine, escapism, dreams, first love, pain, inspiration, frustration, forgiveness. The story, relevant to many yet somewhat uniquely special for you. It's almost a self-help 'narrative' for your struggling adult life - although, I might have watched too many motivational youtube videos, so let's move on.Gameplay difficulty is at zero level, however, it's still quite enjoyable going through mini-games and being a part of interactive storytelling. Controls are quite simple, but I would recommend using your mouse, as it's more convenient (you will see why), but there's full controller support, if you prefer. Florence is unquestionably linear, but the illusion of choice and different interpretations of your own experience may give you something to ponder about at the end. I say: play it twice. The first time, when you are sad; the second time when you are happy. Test your emotions. Embrace the routine. Improve your St Valentine's Day.- Act III - RoutineOnce you beat the game, you'll have access to all the chapters separately, which is useful, if you want to go through all the achievements. It took me about an hour to complete 30 mins game which felt like a brief moment. I wanted more and I played it again. You know it's good when the time feels faster than it actually is. There are also rumors you can speedrun this game for ~15 mins, but I'm not even sure why I'm telling you this? Music also plays a significant role - it's quite lighthearted, but so on point and will dictate the swings of your mood. The original soundtrack is included, so you can listen to it anytime.- Act IV - The EndIn short: it's when simplicity beats everything. It is a simple yet beautiful experience, and after that short period of time with Florence you may forget the details, but you will remember how this game made you feel. Give it a try. Special thank you to the wonderful Samurai Punk team, who have ported this game to both PC & Switch and made this experience possible!  PS: Thank you all for reading - appreciate your time! Much love ~

O.k., now that I've addressed that aspect, I will continue with my take on the game's plot.This plot reminds me of one of my favorite movies, La La Land. Although they are technically love stories, both Florence and La La Land have this seemingly tragic element to them. The relationships do not last. This does not mean that the time spent in said relationships were wasted.In Florence's case, both characters were stuck in ruts before they met, just going through the day-to-day motions. Once they met, and eventually began dating, they started to open up and share their thoughts. Their passions. Because they both developed care and affection for each other, they each pushed one another to pursue said passions. If not for Florence, Krish would not have applied for the music academy; If not for Krish, Florence might not have chased her dream of becoming an artist.Both Florence and Krish set one another on a better path than they were on.While Florence and Krish did not end up together, both hugely impacted one another. This is not a sad story. Sometimes people come into your life only for a season... and it can be a beautiful season! Just because the relationship did not last, that does not mean the memories, lessons, or admiration for the other person has to end as well.This game is good. Check it out.

Bodomi	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bodomi/	Florence is an overpriced 30-minute short novel with an un-relatable, and in my opinion horrible story and extremely monotonous 'puzzles'/mini-games that feels like homework for a young child, matching geometrical shapes together and solving math problems like 8+?=16.What I grasp from the moral of story is that: moms are annoying, digital things are bad, anything but homemade cultural meals are negative, a stable relationship with routine is bad, and a good career change in your mid-20's is to start doing something you did as a toddler and never again after that.The art and music is really good but I don't give games positive reviews because they had a wonderful art-style and good soundtrack, unlike most of the people who have given this game a positive review.In the end it sucked. It was boring, the moral of the story was horrible and the last half of the game was just a bunch of fanciful nonsense that would never happen in reality.It's a banal and dull love story. It tries to be deep, but it really isn't.If the game was longer with a lot more detail on how the 2 main characters relationship developed and way more detail on how she continued her sudden artist career it could maybe be a mediocre thing and not a waste of money, but not this 30-minute crap story with a very sudden ending of her deciding to pursue an art career because she drew as a child, like 99% of all children in her shoes did.Curator pageIf you liked this review or otherwise found it helpful in deciding whether or not to buy this game, feel free to follow my Curator page.Edit: All of a sudden my Steam Curator page link is being censored in this review, shows up just fine in all my other reviews.Edit edit: And it's back, after several hours.Edit edit edit: And a few days ago the review was completely removed from the store page.

Pros- +Great looking art style with visual storytelling that I never really expected. There were so many moments where I sat for a second like, hey that's actually really smart, mainly in regards to having conversations and such +Beautiful OST +Coming of age/relationship based story that I'm sure 99% of people can relate to. The story and pacing is really good, despite there being few words explicitly spoken through the whole gameCons--The game is rather short, which in an of itself isn't a big issue, I just wish we got to experience more of this story! It's difficult to say anything bad about this game, it's a short story-rich experience that can get you feeling all sorts of emotions. If that's your thing, you'll probably dig it!  Rating: 3.5/5 
Kosmozuikis	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kosmozuikis/	Sometimes simplicity is all you need, no words, no fancy graphics, just beautiful art to deliver a powerful messageFlorence is a very short interactive story of a girl and some stages of her life. It's simple, lasts only for about and hour but has a huge impact on you.The idea along with the artstyle is really neat. The whole gameplay is just scrolling through images sometimes doing simple tasks. But those tasks usually have a deeper meaning. There are some moving scenes, again with a meaning.It's a very heartwarming and maybe a little heartbreaking story but so is life. A lot of people will see themselves in this game, same stuff many people go through in their life.Sometimes you need a little push to go on. You make memories, you reminisce about the past, think about how life has changed and how you changed. Falling in love, getting to know that person which at first might seem difficult. Big hurtful words you say without thinking. All the hardships and joyful moments of your life.  But you need to remember even if everything falls down you can start painting your world with colors again. It's all there, represented through simple yet beautiful art. Puzzles (this part completely got me), coloring, walking, it's beautiful. I don't know what it is, but this game has something which triggers emotions and makes you think, maybe go to your partner and hug him/her, tell your mother you love her.Graphically it's very minimalistic but beautifully drawn. Not a lot to talk about graphics.No ultrawide for obvious reasons. Performance? No need to talk about it, if your PC can show pictures it will run this game.Music is really nice and it reflects the emotions your going through but I wish there would be a better transition when music changes.Get this if you appreciate art and interactive stories. The game is great but it's very short, sure it's only 5€ but i'd still suggest waiting for a sale. But hey at least it's not 20€ like Gone Home (loved it too btw, but the price...).ProsBeautiful artGood musicYour life on a plateConsCould be a little longerFollow my curator page for more 
EliteSpartanKiller906	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198346841484/	 Too much for too little? The game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it.  What's inside? Story is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling.  Conclusion I highly recommend this game for anyone with feeeels and without. It's short, but as they say it "packs a punch".

Kosmozuikis	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kosmozuikis/	Sometimes simplicity is all you need, no words, no fancy graphics, just beautiful art to deliver a powerful messageFlorence is a very short interactive story of a girl and some stages of her life. It's simple, lasts only for about and hour but has a huge impact on you.The idea along with the artstyle is really neat. The whole gameplay is just scrolling through images sometimes doing simple tasks. But those tasks usually have a deeper meaning. There are some moving scenes, again with a meaning.It's a very heartwarming and maybe a little heartbreaking story but so is life. A lot of people will see themselves in this game, same stuff many people go through in their life.Sometimes you need a little push to go on. You make memories, you reminisce about the past, think about how life has changed and how you changed. Falling in love, getting to know that person which at first might seem difficult. Big hurtful words you say without thinking. All the hardships and joyful moments of your life.  But you need to remember even if everything falls down you can start painting your world with colors again. It's all there, represented through simple yet beautiful art. Puzzles (this part completely got me), coloring, walking, it's beautiful. I don't know what it is, but this game has something which triggers emotions and makes you think, maybe go to your partner and hug him/her, tell your mother you love her.Graphically it's very minimalistic but beautifully drawn. Not a lot to talk about graphics.No ultrawide for obvious reasons. Performance? No need to talk about it, if your PC can show pictures it will run this game.Music is really nice and it reflects the emotions your going through but I wish there would be a better transition when music changes.Get this if you appreciate art and interactive stories. The game is great but it's very short, sure it's only 5€ but i'd still suggest waiting for a sale.

The game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it.  What's inside? Story is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling.

People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.It paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that "routine" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.I liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters.

Bō / Toni	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055802307/	- Act I - Crush What to do on your sad Valentine's day, when you've canceled your own pity party and felt betrayed by your own feelings? Simple. To play the mobile game you've been hearing some good stuff about, which has been given a surprising Steam release. That's how I was introduced to Florence, anyway. I will skip that part of the game winning every possible award and beating all the best mobile games back when it was originally released. You most likely know that already. Besides, it's not that important. The feelings and experience are all that matters. As Maya Angelou famously said: I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. The same is fair for video games - you may forget many details about them, but you will always remember how some of them made you feel. And Florence? Quality emotions delivery service at the click of your mouse!  - Act II - Happy TogetherA wholesome and elegant mix of webcomic, puzzle game, and walking simulator elements will tell you a simple, ordinary even, story about day-to-day routine, escapism, dreams, first love, pain, inspiration, frustration, forgiveness. The story, relevant to many yet somewhat uniquely special for you. It's almost a self-help 'narrative' for your struggling adult life - although, I might have watched too many motivational youtube videos, so let's move on.Gameplay difficulty is at zero level, however, it's still quite enjoyable going through mini-games and being a part of interactive storytelling. Controls are quite simple, but I would recommend using your mouse, as it's more convenient (you will see why), but there's full controller support, if you prefer. Florence is unquestionably linear, but the illusion of choice and different interpretations of your own experience may give you something to ponder about at the end. I say: play it twice. The first time, when you are sad; the second time when you are happy. Test your emotions. Embrace the routine. Improve your St Valentine's Day.- Act III - RoutineOnce you beat the game, you'll have access to all the chapters separately, which is useful, if you want to go through all the achievements. It took me about an hour to complete 30 mins game which felt like a brief moment. I wanted more and I played it again. You know it's good when the time feels faster than it actually is. There are also rumors you can speedrun this game for ~15 mins, but I'm not even sure why I'm telling you this? Music also plays a significant role - it's quite lighthearted, but so on point and will dictate the swings of your mood. The original soundtrack is included, so you can listen to it anytime.- Act IV - The EndIn short: it's when simplicity beats everything. It is a simple yet beautiful experience, and after that short period of time with Florence you may forget the details, but you will remember how this game made you feel. Give it a try. Special thank you to the wonderful Samurai Punk team, who have ported this game to both PC & Switch and made this experience possible!  PS: Thank you all for reading - appreciate your time!

kgsizemo	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198202715070/	My girl does not like crust! ---- SPOILERS!!!! ---- First, let me say that the score for this game is phenomenal! O.k., now that I've addressed that aspect, I will continue with my take on the game's plot.This plot reminds me of one of my favorite movies, La La Land. Although they are technically love stories, both Florence and La La Land have this seemingly tragic element to them. The relationships do not last. This does not mean that the time spent in said relationships were wasted.In Florence's case, both characters were stuck in ruts before they met, just going through the day-to-day motions. Once they met, and eventually began dating, they started to open up and share their thoughts. Their passions. Because they both developed care and affection for each other, they each pushed one another to pursue said passions. If not for Florence, Krish would not have applied for the music academy; If not for Krish, Florence might not have chased her dream of becoming an artist.Both Florence and Krish set one another on a better path than they were on.While Florence and Krish did not end up together, both hugely impacted one another. This is not a sad story. Sometimes people come into your life only for a season... and it can be a beautiful season! Just because the relationship did not last, that does not mean the memories, lessons, or admiration for the other person has to end as well.This game is good. Check it out.

Bodomi	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bodomi/	Florence is an overpriced 30-minute short novel with an un-relatable, and in my opinion horrible story and extremely monotonous 'puzzles'/mini-games that feels like homework for a young child, matching geometrical shapes together and solving math problems like 8+?=16.What I grasp from the moral of story is that: moms are annoying, digital things are bad, anything but homemade cultural meals are negative, a stable relationship with routine is bad, and a good career change in your mid-20's is to start doing something you did as a toddler and never again after that.The art and music is really good but I don't give games positive reviews because they had a wonderful art-style and good soundtrack, unlike most of the people who have given this game a positive review.In the end it sucked. It was boring, the moral of the story was horrible and the last half of the game was just a bunch of fanciful nonsense that would never happen in reality.It's a banal and dull love story. It tries to be deep, but it really isn't.If the game was longer with a lot more detail on how the 2 main characters relationship developed and way more detail on how she continued her sudden artist career it could maybe be a mediocre thing and not a waste of money, but not this 30-minute crap story with a very sudden ending of her deciding to pursue an art career because she drew as a child, like 99% of all children in her shoes did.Curator pageIf you liked this review or otherwise found it helpful in deciding whether or not to buy this game, feel free to follow my Curator page.Edit: All of a sudden my Steam Curator page link is being censored in this review, shows up just fine in all my other reviews.Edit edit: And it's back, after several hours.Edit edit edit: And a few days ago the review was completely removed from the store page.

O.k., now that I've addressed that aspect, I will continue with my take on the game's plot.This plot reminds me of one of my favorite movies, La La Land. Although they are technically love stories, both Florence and La La Land have this seemingly tragic element to them. The relationships do not last. This does not mean that the time spent in said relationships were wasted.In Florence's case, both characters were stuck in ruts before they met, just going through the day-to-day motions. Once they met, and eventually began dating, they started to open up and share their thoughts. Their passions. Because they both developed care and affection for each other, they each pushed one another to pursue said passions. If not for Florence, Krish would not have applied for the music academy; If not for Krish, Florence might not have chased her dream of becoming an artist.Both Florence and Krish set one another on a better path than they were on.While Florence and Krish did not end up together, both hugely impacted one another. This is not a sad story. Sometimes people come into your life only for a season... and it can be a beautiful season!

Bodomi	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bodomi/	Florence is an overpriced 30-minute short novel with an un-relatable, and in my opinion horrible story and extremely monotonous 'puzzles'/mini-games that feels like homework for a young child, matching geometrical shapes together and solving math problems like 8+?=16.What I grasp from the moral of story is that: moms are annoying, digital things are bad, anything but homemade cultural meals are negative, a stable relationship with routine is bad, and a good career change in your mid-20's is to start doing something you did as a toddler and never again after that.The art and music is really good but I don't give games positive reviews because they had a wonderful art-style and good soundtrack, unlike most of the people who have given this game a positive review.In the end it sucked. It was boring, the moral of the story was horrible and the last half of the game was just a bunch of fanciful nonsense that would never happen in reality.It's a banal and dull love story. It tries to be deep, but it really isn't.If the game was longer with a lot more detail on how the 2 main characters relationship developed and way more detail on how she continued her sudden artist career it could maybe be a mediocre thing and not a waste of money, but not this 30-minute crap story with a very sudden ending of her deciding to pursue an art career because she drew as a child, like 99% of all children in her shoes did.Curator pageIf you liked this review or otherwise found it helpful in deciding whether or not to buy this game, feel free to follow my Curator page.Edit: All of a sudden my Steam Curator page link is being censored in this review, shows up just fine in all my other reviews.Edit edit: And it's back, after several hours.Edit edit edit: And a few days ago the review was completely removed from the store page.

Kosmozuikis	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kosmozuikis/	Sometimes simplicity is all you need, no words, no fancy graphics, just beautiful art to deliver a powerful messageFlorence is a very short interactive story of a girl and some stages of her life. It's simple, lasts only for about and hour but has a huge impact on you.The idea along with the artstyle is really neat. The whole gameplay is just scrolling through images sometimes doing simple tasks. But those tasks usually have a deeper meaning. There are some moving scenes, again with a meaning.It's a very heartwarming and maybe a little heartbreaking story but so is life. A lot of people will see themselves in this game, same stuff many people go through in their life.Sometimes you need a little push to go on. You make memories, you reminisce about the past, think about how life has changed and how you changed. Falling in love, getting to know that person which at first might seem difficult. Big hurtful words you say without thinking. All the hardships and joyful moments of your life.  But you need to remember even if everything falls down you can start painting your world with colors again. It's all there, represented through simple yet beautiful art. Puzzles (this part completely got me), coloring, walking, it's beautiful. I don't know what it is, but this game has something which triggers emotions and makes you think, maybe go to your partner and hug him/her, tell your mother you love her.Graphically it's very minimalistic but beautifully drawn. Not a lot to talk about graphics.No ultrawide for obvious reasons. Performance? No need to talk about it, if your PC can show pictures it will run this game.Music is really nice and it reflects the emotions your going through but I wish there would be a better transition when music changes.Get this if you appreciate art and interactive stories. The game is great but it's very short, sure it's only 5€ but i'd still suggest waiting for a sale.

EliteSpartanKiller906	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198346841484/	 Too much for too little? The game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it.  What's inside? Story is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling.  Conclusion I highly recommend this game for anyone with feeeels and without. It's short, but as they say it "packs a punch".

i_Go_SpLaT	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/i_Go_SpLaT/	Started strong, ended annoyingly.Moral of the story? People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.It paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that "routine" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.I liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.At least it was short. 
Bō / Toni	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055802307/	- Act I - Crush What to do on your sad Valentine's day, when you've canceled your own pity party and felt betrayed by your own feelings? Simple. To play the mobile game you've been hearing some good stuff about, which has been given a surprising Steam release. That's how I was introduced to Florence, anyway. I will skip that part of the game winning every possible award and beating all the best mobile games back when it was originally released. You most likely know that already. Besides, it's not that important. The feelings and experience are all that matters. As Maya Angelou famously said: I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. The same is fair for video games - you may forget many details about them, but you will always remember how some of them made you feel. And Florence? Quality emotions delivery service at the click of your mouse!  - Act II - Happy TogetherA wholesome and elegant mix of webcomic, puzzle game, and walking simulator elements will tell you a simple, ordinary even, story about day-to-day routine, escapism, dreams, first love, pain, inspiration, frustration, forgiveness. The story, relevant to many yet somewhat uniquely special for you. It's almost a self-help 'narrative' for your struggling adult life - although, I might have watched too many motivational youtube videos, so let's move on.Gameplay difficulty is at zero level, however, it's still quite enjoyable going through mini-games and being a part of interactive storytelling. Controls are quite simple, but I would recommend using your mouse, as it's more convenient (you will see why), but there's full controller support, if you prefer. Florence is unquestionably linear, but the illusion of choice and different interpretations of your own experience may give you something to ponder about at the end. I say: play it twice. The first time, when you are sad; the second time when you are happy. Test your emotions. Embrace the routine. Improve your St Valentine's Day.- Act III - RoutineOnce you beat the game, you'll have access to all the chapters separately, which is useful, if you want to go through all the achievements. It took me about an hour to complete 30 mins game which felt like a brief moment. I wanted more and I played it again. You know it's good when the time feels faster than it actually is. There are also rumors you can speedrun this game for ~15 mins, but I'm not even sure why I'm telling you this? Music also plays a significant role - it's quite lighthearted, but so on point and will dictate the swings of your mood. The original soundtrack is included, so you can listen to it anytime.- Act IV - The EndIn short: it's when simplicity beats everything. It is a simple yet beautiful experience, and after that short period of time with Florence you may forget the details, but you will remember how this game made you feel. Give it a try. Special thank you to the wonderful Samurai Punk team, who have ported this game to both PC & Switch and made this experience possible!  PS: Thank you all for reading - appreciate your time!

People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.It paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that "routine" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.I liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.At least it was short. 
Bō / Toni	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055802307/	- Act I - Crush What to do on your sad Valentine's day, when you've canceled your own pity party and felt betrayed by your own feelings? Simple. To play the mobile game you've been hearing some good stuff about, which has been given a surprising Steam release. That's how I was introduced to Florence, anyway. I will skip that part of the game winning every possible award and beating all the best mobile games back when it was originally released. You most likely know that already. Besides, it's not that important. The feelings and experience are all that matters. As Maya Angelou famously said: I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. The same is fair for video games - you may forget many details about them, but you will always remember how some of them made you feel. And Florence? Quality emotions delivery service at the click of your mouse!  - Act II - Happy TogetherA wholesome and elegant mix of webcomic, puzzle game, and walking simulator elements will tell you a simple, ordinary even, story about day-to-day routine, escapism, dreams, first love, pain, inspiration, frustration, forgiveness. The story, relevant to many yet somewhat uniquely special for you. It's almost a self-help 'narrative' for your struggling adult life - although, I might have watched too many motivational youtube videos, so let's move on.Gameplay difficulty is at zero level, however, it's still quite enjoyable going through mini-games and being a part of interactive storytelling. Controls are quite simple, but I would recommend using your mouse, as it's more convenient (you will see why), but there's full controller support, if you prefer. Florence is unquestionably linear, but the illusion of choice and different interpretations of your own experience may give you something to ponder about at the end. I say: play it twice. The first time, when you are sad; the second time when you are happy. Test your emotions. Embrace the routine. Improve your St Valentine's Day.- Act III - RoutineOnce you beat the game, you'll have access to all the chapters separately, which is useful, if you want to go through all the achievements. It took me about an hour to complete 30 mins game which felt like a brief moment. I wanted more and I played it again. You know it's good when the time feels faster than it actually is. There are also rumors you can speedrun this game for ~15 mins, but I'm not even sure why I'm telling you this? Music also plays a significant role - it's quite lighthearted, but so on point and will dictate the swings of your mood. The original soundtrack is included, so you can listen to it anytime.- Act IV - The EndIn short: it's when simplicity beats everything. It is a simple yet beautiful experience, and after that short period of time with Florence you may forget the details, but you will remember how this game made you feel. Give it a try. Special thank you to the wonderful Samurai Punk team, who have ported this game to both PC & Switch and made this experience possible!  PS: Thank you all for reading - appreciate your time! Much love ~

O.k., now that I've addressed that aspect, I will continue with my take on the game's plot.This plot reminds me of one of my favorite movies, La La Land. Although they are technically love stories, both Florence and La La Land have this seemingly tragic element to them. The relationships do not last. This does not mean that the time spent in said relationships were wasted.In Florence's case, both characters were stuck in ruts before they met, just going through the day-to-day motions. Once they met, and eventually began dating, they started to open up and share their thoughts. Their passions. Because they both developed care and affection for each other, they each pushed one another to pursue said passions. If not for Florence, Krish would not have applied for the music academy; If not for Krish, Florence might not have chased her dream of becoming an artist.Both Florence and Krish set one another on a better path than they were on.While Florence and Krish did not end up together, both hugely impacted one another. This is not a sad story. Sometimes people come into your life only for a season... and it can be a beautiful season! Just because the relationship did not last, that does not mean the memories, lessons, or admiration for the other person has to end as well.This game is good. Check it out.

Bodomi	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bodomi/	Florence is an overpriced 30-minute short novel with an un-relatable, and in my opinion horrible story and extremely monotonous 'puzzles'/mini-games that feels like homework for a young child, matching geometrical shapes together and solving math problems like 8+?=16.What I grasp from the moral of story is that: moms are annoying, digital things are bad, anything but homemade cultural meals are negative, a stable relationship with routine is bad, and a good career change in your mid-20's is to start doing something you did as a toddler and never again after that.The art and music is really good but I don't give games positive reviews because they had a wonderful art-style and good soundtrack, unlike most of the people who have given this game a positive review.In the end it sucked. It was boring, the moral of the story was horrible and the last half of the game was just a bunch of fanciful nonsense that would never happen in reality.It's a banal and dull love story. It tries to be deep, but it really isn't.If the game was longer with a lot more detail on how the 2 main characters relationship developed and way more detail on how she continued her sudden artist career it could maybe be a mediocre thing and not a waste of money, but not this 30-minute crap story with a very sudden ending of her deciding to pursue an art career because she drew as a child, like 99% of all children in her shoes did.Curator pageIf you liked this review or otherwise found it helpful in deciding whether or not to buy this game, feel free to follow my Curator page.Edit: All of a sudden my Steam Curator page link is being censored in this review, shows up just fine in all my other reviews.Edit edit: And it's back, after several hours.Edit edit edit: And a few days ago the review was completely removed from the store page.

Pros- +Great looking art style with visual storytelling that I never really expected. There were so many moments where I sat for a second like, hey that's actually really smart, mainly in regards to having conversations and such +Beautiful OST +Coming of age/relationship based story that I'm sure 99% of people can relate to. The story and pacing is really good, despite there being few words explicitly spoken through the whole gameCons--The game is rather short, which in an of itself isn't a big issue, I just wish we got to experience more of this story! It's difficult to say anything bad about this game, it's a short story-rich experience that can get you feeling all sorts of emotions. If that's your thing, you'll probably dig it!  Rating: 3.5/5 
Kosmozuikis	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kosmozuikis/	Sometimes simplicity is all you need, no words, no fancy graphics, just beautiful art to deliver a powerful messageFlorence is a very short interactive story of a girl and some stages of her life. It's simple, lasts only for about and hour but has a huge impact on you.The idea along with the artstyle is really neat. The whole gameplay is just scrolling through images sometimes doing simple tasks. But those tasks usually have a deeper meaning. There are some moving scenes, again with a meaning.It's a very heartwarming and maybe a little heartbreaking story but so is life. A lot of people will see themselves in this game, same stuff many people go through in their life.Sometimes you need a little push to go on. You make memories, you reminisce about the past, think about how life has changed and how you changed. Falling in love, getting to know that person which at first might seem difficult. Big hurtful words you say without thinking. All the hardships and joyful moments of your life.  But you need to remember even if everything falls down you can start painting your world with colors again. It's all there, represented through simple yet beautiful art. Puzzles (this part completely got me), coloring, walking, it's beautiful. I don't know what it is, but this game has something which triggers emotions and makes you think, maybe go to your partner and hug him/her, tell your mother you love her.Graphically it's very minimalistic but beautifully drawn. Not a lot to talk about graphics.No ultrawide for obvious reasons. Performance? No need to talk about it, if your PC can show pictures it will run this game.Music is really nice and it reflects the emotions your going through but I wish there would be a better transition when music changes.Get this if you appreciate art and interactive stories. The game is great but it's very short, sure it's only 5€ but i'd still suggest waiting for a sale. But hey at least it's not 20€ like Gone Home (loved it too btw, but the price...).ProsBeautiful artGood musicYour life on a plateConsCould be a little longerFollow my curator page for more 
EliteSpartanKiller906	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198346841484/	 Too much for too little? The game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it.  What's inside? Story is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling.  Conclusion I highly recommend this game for anyone with feeeels and without. It's short, but as they say it "packs a punch".

Kosmozuikis	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kosmozuikis/	Sometimes simplicity is all you need, no words, no fancy graphics, just beautiful art to deliver a powerful messageFlorence is a very short interactive story of a girl and some stages of her life. It's simple, lasts only for about and hour but has a huge impact on you.The idea along with the artstyle is really neat. The whole gameplay is just scrolling through images sometimes doing simple tasks. But those tasks usually have a deeper meaning. There are some moving scenes, again with a meaning.It's a very heartwarming and maybe a little heartbreaking story but so is life. A lot of people will see themselves in this game, same stuff many people go through in their life.Sometimes you need a little push to go on. You make memories, you reminisce about the past, think about how life has changed and how you changed. Falling in love, getting to know that person which at first might seem difficult. Big hurtful words you say without thinking. All the hardships and joyful moments of your life.  But you need to remember even if everything falls down you can start painting your world with colors again. It's all there, represented through simple yet beautiful art. Puzzles (this part completely got me), coloring, walking, it's beautiful. I don't know what it is, but this game has something which triggers emotions and makes you think, maybe go to your partner and hug him/her, tell your mother you love her.Graphically it's very minimalistic but beautifully drawn. Not a lot to talk about graphics.No ultrawide for obvious reasons. Performance? No need to talk about it, if your PC can show pictures it will run this game.Music is really nice and it reflects the emotions your going through but I wish there would be a better transition when music changes.Get this if you appreciate art and interactive stories. The game is great but it's very short, sure it's only 5€ but i'd still suggest waiting for a sale.

The game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it.  What's inside? Story is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling.

People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.It paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that "routine" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.I liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters.

Bō / Toni	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055802307/	- Act I - Crush What to do on your sad Valentine's day, when you've canceled your own pity party and felt betrayed by your own feelings? Simple. To play the mobile game you've been hearing some good stuff about, which has been given a surprising Steam release. That's how I was introduced to Florence, anyway. I will skip that part of the game winning every possible award and beating all the best mobile games back when it was originally released. You most likely know that already. Besides, it's not that important. The feelings and experience are all that matters. As Maya Angelou famously said: I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. The same is fair for video games - you may forget many details about them, but you will always remember how some of them made you feel. And Florence? Quality emotions delivery service at the click of your mouse!  - Act II - Happy TogetherA wholesome and elegant mix of webcomic, puzzle game, and walking simulator elements will tell you a simple, ordinary even, story about day-to-day routine, escapism, dreams, first love, pain, inspiration, frustration, forgiveness. The story, relevant to many yet somewhat uniquely special for you. It's almost a self-help 'narrative' for your struggling adult life - although, I might have watched too many motivational youtube videos, so let's move on.Gameplay difficulty is at zero level, however, it's still quite enjoyable going through mini-games and being a part of interactive storytelling. Controls are quite simple, but I would recommend using your mouse, as it's more convenient (you will see why), but there's full controller support, if you prefer. Florence is unquestionably linear, but the illusion of choice and different interpretations of your own experience may give you something to ponder about at the end. I say: play it twice. The first time, when you are sad; the second time when you are happy. Test your emotions. Embrace the routine. Improve your St Valentine's Day.- Act III - RoutineOnce you beat the game, you'll have access to all the chapters separately, which is useful, if you want to go through all the achievements. It took me about an hour to complete 30 mins game which felt like a brief moment. I wanted more and I played it again. You know it's good when the time feels faster than it actually is. There are also rumors you can speedrun this game for ~15 mins, but I'm not even sure why I'm telling you this? Music also plays a significant role - it's quite lighthearted, but so on point and will dictate the swings of your mood. The original soundtrack is included, so you can listen to it anytime.- Act IV - The EndIn short: it's when simplicity beats everything. It is a simple yet beautiful experience, and after that short period of time with Florence you may forget the details, but you will remember how this game made you feel. Give it a try. Special thank you to the wonderful Samurai Punk team, who have ported this game to both PC & Switch and made this experience possible!  PS: Thank you all for reading - appreciate your time!

kgsizemo	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198202715070/	My girl does not like crust! ---- SPOILERS!!!! ---- First, let me say that the score for this game is phenomenal! O.k., now that I've addressed that aspect, I will continue with my take on the game's plot.This plot reminds me of one of my favorite movies, La La Land. Although they are technically love stories, both Florence and La La Land have this seemingly tragic element to them. The relationships do not last. This does not mean that the time spent in said relationships were wasted.In Florence's case, both characters were stuck in ruts before they met, just going through the day-to-day motions. Once they met, and eventually began dating, they started to open up and share their thoughts. Their passions. Because they both developed care and affection for each other, they each pushed one another to pursue said passions. If not for Florence, Krish would not have applied for the music academy; If not for Krish, Florence might not have chased her dream of becoming an artist.Both Florence and Krish set one another on a better path than they were on.While Florence and Krish did not end up together, both hugely impacted one another. This is not a sad story. Sometimes people come into your life only for a season... and it can be a beautiful season! Just because the relationship did not last, that does not mean the memories, lessons, or admiration for the other person has to end as well.This game is good. Check it out.

Bodomi	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bodomi/	Florence is an overpriced 30-minute short novel with an un-relatable, and in my opinion horrible story and extremely monotonous 'puzzles'/mini-games that feels like homework for a young child, matching geometrical shapes together and solving math problems like 8+?=16.What I grasp from the moral of story is that: moms are annoying, digital things are bad, anything but homemade cultural meals are negative, a stable relationship with routine is bad, and a good career change in your mid-20's is to start doing something you did as a toddler and never again after that.The art and music is really good but I don't give games positive reviews because they had a wonderful art-style and good soundtrack, unlike most of the people who have given this game a positive review.In the end it sucked. It was boring, the moral of the story was horrible and the last half of the game was just a bunch of fanciful nonsense that would never happen in reality.It's a banal and dull love story. It tries to be deep, but it really isn't.If the game was longer with a lot more detail on how the 2 main characters relationship developed and way more detail on how she continued her sudden artist career it could maybe be a mediocre thing and not a waste of money, but not this 30-minute crap story with a very sudden ending of her deciding to pursue an art career because she drew as a child, like 99% of all children in her shoes did.Curator pageIf you liked this review or otherwise found it helpful in deciding whether or not to buy this game, feel free to follow my Curator page.Edit: All of a sudden my Steam Curator page link is being censored in this review, shows up just fine in all my other reviews.Edit edit: And it's back, after several hours.Edit edit edit: And a few days ago the review was completely removed from the store page.

O.k., now that I've addressed that aspect, I will continue with my take on the game's plot.This plot reminds me of one of my favorite movies, La La Land. Although they are technically love stories, both Florence and La La Land have this seemingly tragic element to them. The relationships do not last. This does not mean that the time spent in said relationships were wasted.In Florence's case, both characters were stuck in ruts before they met, just going through the day-to-day motions. Once they met, and eventually began dating, they started to open up and share their thoughts. Their passions. Because they both developed care and affection for each other, they each pushed one another to pursue said passions. If not for Florence, Krish would not have applied for the music academy; If not for Krish, Florence might not have chased her dream of becoming an artist.Both Florence and Krish set one another on a better path than they were on.While Florence and Krish did not end up together, both hugely impacted one another. This is not a sad story. Sometimes people come into your life only for a season... and it can be a beautiful season!

Bodomi	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bodomi/	Florence is an overpriced 30-minute short novel with an un-relatable, and in my opinion horrible story and extremely monotonous 'puzzles'/mini-games that feels like homework for a young child, matching geometrical shapes together and solving math problems like 8+?=16.What I grasp from the moral of story is that: moms are annoying, digital things are bad, anything but homemade cultural meals are negative, a stable relationship with routine is bad, and a good career change in your mid-20's is to start doing something you did as a toddler and never again after that.The art and music is really good but I don't give games positive reviews because they had a wonderful art-style and good soundtrack, unlike most of the people who have given this game a positive review.In the end it sucked. It was boring, the moral of the story was horrible and the last half of the game was just a bunch of fanciful nonsense that would never happen in reality.It's a banal and dull love story. It tries to be deep, but it really isn't.If the game was longer with a lot more detail on how the 2 main characters relationship developed and way more detail on how she continued her sudden artist career it could maybe be a mediocre thing and not a waste of money, but not this 30-minute crap story with a very sudden ending of her deciding to pursue an art career because she drew as a child, like 99% of all children in her shoes did.Curator pageIf you liked this review or otherwise found it helpful in deciding whether or not to buy this game, feel free to follow my Curator page.Edit: All of a sudden my Steam Curator page link is being censored in this review, shows up just fine in all my other reviews.Edit edit: And it's back, after several hours.Edit edit edit: And a few days ago the review was completely removed from the store page.

Kosmozuikis	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kosmozuikis/	Sometimes simplicity is all you need, no words, no fancy graphics, just beautiful art to deliver a powerful messageFlorence is a very short interactive story of a girl and some stages of her life. It's simple, lasts only for about and hour but has a huge impact on you.The idea along with the artstyle is really neat. The whole gameplay is just scrolling through images sometimes doing simple tasks. But those tasks usually have a deeper meaning. There are some moving scenes, again with a meaning.It's a very heartwarming and maybe a little heartbreaking story but so is life. A lot of people will see themselves in this game, same stuff many people go through in their life.Sometimes you need a little push to go on. You make memories, you reminisce about the past, think about how life has changed and how you changed. Falling in love, getting to know that person which at first might seem difficult. Big hurtful words you say without thinking. All the hardships and joyful moments of your life.  But you need to remember even if everything falls down you can start painting your world with colors again. It's all there, represented through simple yet beautiful art. Puzzles (this part completely got me), coloring, walking, it's beautiful. I don't know what it is, but this game has something which triggers emotions and makes you think, maybe go to your partner and hug him/her, tell your mother you love her.Graphically it's very minimalistic but beautifully drawn. Not a lot to talk about graphics.No ultrawide for obvious reasons. Performance? No need to talk about it, if your PC can show pictures it will run this game.Music is really nice and it reflects the emotions your going through but I wish there would be a better transition when music changes.Get this if you appreciate art and interactive stories. The game is great but it's very short, sure it's only 5€ but i'd still suggest waiting for a sale.

EliteSpartanKiller906	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198346841484/	 Too much for too little? The game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it.  What's inside? Story is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling.  Conclusion I highly recommend this game for anyone with feeeels and without. It's short, but as they say it "packs a punch".

i_Go_SpLaT	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/i_Go_SpLaT/	Started strong, ended annoyingly.Moral of the story? People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.It paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that "routine" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.I liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.At least it was short. 
Bō / Toni	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055802307/	- Act I - Crush What to do on your sad Valentine's day, when you've canceled your own pity party and felt betrayed by your own feelings? Simple. To play the mobile game you've been hearing some good stuff about, which has been given a surprising Steam release. That's how I was introduced to Florence, anyway. I will skip that part of the game winning every possible award and beating all the best mobile games back when it was originally released. You most likely know that already. Besides, it's not that important. The feelings and experience are all that matters. As Maya Angelou famously said: I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. The same is fair for video games - you may forget many details about them, but you will always remember how some of them made you feel. And Florence? Quality emotions delivery service at the click of your mouse!  - Act II - Happy TogetherA wholesome and elegant mix of webcomic, puzzle game, and walking simulator elements will tell you a simple, ordinary even, story about day-to-day routine, escapism, dreams, first love, pain, inspiration, frustration, forgiveness. The story, relevant to many yet somewhat uniquely special for you. It's almost a self-help 'narrative' for your struggling adult life - although, I might have watched too many motivational youtube videos, so let's move on.Gameplay difficulty is at zero level, however, it's still quite enjoyable going through mini-games and being a part of interactive storytelling. Controls are quite simple, but I would recommend using your mouse, as it's more convenient (you will see why), but there's full controller support, if you prefer. Florence is unquestionably linear, but the illusion of choice and different interpretations of your own experience may give you something to ponder about at the end. I say: play it twice. The first time, when you are sad; the second time when you are happy. Test your emotions. Embrace the routine. Improve your St Valentine's Day.- Act III - RoutineOnce you beat the game, you'll have access to all the chapters separately, which is useful, if you want to go through all the achievements. It took me about an hour to complete 30 mins game which felt like a brief moment. I wanted more and I played it again. You know it's good when the time feels faster than it actually is. There are also rumors you can speedrun this game for ~15 mins, but I'm not even sure why I'm telling you this? Music also plays a significant role - it's quite lighthearted, but so on point and will dictate the swings of your mood. The original soundtrack is included, so you can listen to it anytime.- Act IV - The EndIn short: it's when simplicity beats everything. It is a simple yet beautiful experience, and after that short period of time with Florence you may forget the details, but you will remember how this game made you feel. Give it a try. Special thank you to the wonderful Samurai Punk team, who have ported this game to both PC & Switch and made this experience possible!  PS: Thank you all for reading - appreciate your time!

People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.It paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that "routine" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.I liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.At least it was short. 
Bō / Toni	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055802307/	- Act I - Crush What to do on your sad Valentine's day, when you've canceled your own pity party and felt betrayed by your own feelings? Simple. To play the mobile game you've been hearing some good stuff about, which has been given a surprising Steam release. That's how I was introduced to Florence, anyway. I will skip that part of the game winning every possible award and beating all the best mobile games back when it was originally released. You most likely know that already. Besides, it's not that important. The feelings and experience are all that matters. As Maya Angelou famously said: I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. The same is fair for video games - you may forget many details about them, but you will always remember how some of them made you feel. And Florence? Quality emotions delivery service at the click of your mouse!  - Act II - Happy TogetherA wholesome and elegant mix of webcomic, puzzle game, and walking simulator elements will tell you a simple, ordinary even, story about day-to-day routine, escapism, dreams, first love, pain, inspiration, frustration, forgiveness. The story, relevant to many yet somewhat uniquely special for you. It's almost a self-help 'narrative' for your struggling adult life - although, I might have watched too many motivational youtube videos, so let's move on.Gameplay difficulty is at zero level, however, it's still quite enjoyable going through mini-games and being a part of interactive storytelling. Controls are quite simple, but I would recommend using your mouse, as it's more convenient (you will see why), but there's full controller support, if you prefer. Florence is unquestionably linear, but the illusion of choice and different interpretations of your own experience may give you something to ponder about at the end. I say: play it twice. The first time, when you are sad; the second time when you are happy. Test your emotions. Embrace the routine. Improve your St Valentine's Day.- Act III - RoutineOnce you beat the game, you'll have access to all the chapters separately, which is useful, if you want to go through all the achievements. It took me about an hour to complete 30 mins game which felt like a brief moment. I wanted more and I played it again. You know it's good when the time feels faster than it actually is. There are also rumors you can speedrun this game for ~15 mins, but I'm not even sure why I'm telling you this? Music also plays a significant role - it's quite lighthearted, but so on point and will dictate the swings of your mood. The original soundtrack is included, so you can listen to it anytime.- Act IV - The EndIn short: it's when simplicity beats everything. It is a simple yet beautiful experience, and after that short period of time with Florence you may forget the details, but you will remember how this game made you feel. Give it a try. Special thank you to the wonderful Samurai Punk team, who have ported this game to both PC & Switch and made this experience possible!  PS: Thank you all for reading - appreciate your time! Much love ~

O.k., now that I've addressed that aspect, I will continue with my take on the game's plot.This plot reminds me of one of my favorite movies, La La Land. Although they are technically love stories, both Florence and La La Land have this seemingly tragic element to them. The relationships do not last. This does not mean that the time spent in said relationships were wasted.In Florence's case, both characters were stuck in ruts before they met, just going through the day-to-day motions. Once they met, and eventually began dating, they started to open up and share their thoughts. Their passions. Because they both developed care and affection for each other, they each pushed one another to pursue said passions. If not for Florence, Krish would not have applied for the music academy; If not for Krish, Florence might not have chased her dream of becoming an artist.Both Florence and Krish set one another on a better path than they were on.While Florence and Krish did not end up together, both hugely impacted one another. This is not a sad story. Sometimes people come into your life only for a season... and it can be a beautiful season! Just because the relationship did not last, that does not mean the memories, lessons, or admiration for the other person has to end as well.This game is good. Check it out.

Bodomi	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bodomi/	Florence is an overpriced 30-minute short novel with an un-relatable, and in my opinion horrible story and extremely monotonous 'puzzles'/mini-games that feels like homework for a young child, matching geometrical shapes together and solving math problems like 8+?=16.What I grasp from the moral of story is that: moms are annoying, digital things are bad, anything but homemade cultural meals are negative, a stable relationship with routine is bad, and a good career change in your mid-20's is to start doing something you did as a toddler and never again after that.The art and music is really good but I don't give games positive reviews because they had a wonderful art-style and good soundtrack, unlike most of the people who have given this game a positive review.In the end it sucked. It was boring, the moral of the story was horrible and the last half of the game was just a bunch of fanciful nonsense that would never happen in reality.It's a banal and dull love story. It tries to be deep, but it really isn't.If the game was longer with a lot more detail on how the 2 main characters relationship developed and way more detail on how she continued her sudden artist career it could maybe be a mediocre thing and not a waste of money, but not this 30-minute crap story with a very sudden ending of her deciding to pursue an art career because she drew as a child, like 99% of all children in her shoes did.Curator pageIf you liked this review or otherwise found it helpful in deciding whether or not to buy this game, feel free to follow my Curator page.Edit: All of a sudden my Steam Curator page link is being censored in this review, shows up just fine in all my other reviews.Edit edit: And it's back, after several hours.Edit edit edit: And a few days ago the review was completely removed from the store page.

Pros- +Great looking art style with visual storytelling that I never really expected. There were so many moments where I sat for a second like, hey that's actually really smart, mainly in regards to having conversations and such +Beautiful OST +Coming of age/relationship based story that I'm sure 99% of people can relate to. The story and pacing is really good, despite there being few words explicitly spoken through the whole gameCons--The game is rather short, which in an of itself isn't a big issue, I just wish we got to experience more of this story! It's difficult to say anything bad about this game, it's a short story-rich experience that can get you feeling all sorts of emotions. If that's your thing, you'll probably dig it!  Rating: 3.5/5 
Kosmozuikis	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kosmozuikis/	Sometimes simplicity is all you need, no words, no fancy graphics, just beautiful art to deliver a powerful messageFlorence is a very short interactive story of a girl and some stages of her life. It's simple, lasts only for about and hour but has a huge impact on you.The idea along with the artstyle is really neat. The whole gameplay is just scrolling through images sometimes doing simple tasks. But those tasks usually have a deeper meaning. There are some moving scenes, again with a meaning.It's a very heartwarming and maybe a little heartbreaking story but so is life. A lot of people will see themselves in this game, same stuff many people go through in their life.Sometimes you need a little push to go on. You make memories, you reminisce about the past, think about how life has changed and how you changed. Falling in love, getting to know that person which at first might seem difficult. Big hurtful words you say without thinking. All the hardships and joyful moments of your life.  But you need to remember even if everything falls down you can start painting your world with colors again. It's all there, represented through simple yet beautiful art. Puzzles (this part completely got me), coloring, walking, it's beautiful. I don't know what it is, but this game has something which triggers emotions and makes you think, maybe go to your partner and hug him/her, tell your mother you love her.Graphically it's very minimalistic but beautifully drawn. Not a lot to talk about graphics.No ultrawide for obvious reasons. Performance? No need to talk about it, if your PC can show pictures it will run this game.Music is really nice and it reflects the emotions your going through but I wish there would be a better transition when music changes.Get this if you appreciate art and interactive stories. The game is great but it's very short, sure it's only 5€ but i'd still suggest waiting for a sale. But hey at least it's not 20€ like Gone Home (loved it too btw, but the price...).ProsBeautiful artGood musicYour life on a plateConsCould be a little longerFollow my curator page for more 
EliteSpartanKiller906	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198346841484/	 Too much for too little? The game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it.  What's inside? Story is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling.  Conclusion I highly recommend this game for anyone with feeeels and without. It's short, but as they say it "packs a punch".

Kosmozuikis	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kosmozuikis/	Sometimes simplicity is all you need, no words, no fancy graphics, just beautiful art to deliver a powerful messageFlorence is a very short interactive story of a girl and some stages of her life. It's simple, lasts only for about and hour but has a huge impact on you.The idea along with the artstyle is really neat. The whole gameplay is just scrolling through images sometimes doing simple tasks. But those tasks usually have a deeper meaning. There are some moving scenes, again with a meaning.It's a very heartwarming and maybe a little heartbreaking story but so is life. A lot of people will see themselves in this game, same stuff many people go through in their life.Sometimes you need a little push to go on. You make memories, you reminisce about the past, think about how life has changed and how you changed. Falling in love, getting to know that person which at first might seem difficult. Big hurtful words you say without thinking. All the hardships and joyful moments of your life.  But you need to remember even if everything falls down you can start painting your world with colors again. It's all there, represented through simple yet beautiful art. Puzzles (this part completely got me), coloring, walking, it's beautiful. I don't know what it is, but this game has something which triggers emotions and makes you think, maybe go to your partner and hug him/her, tell your mother you love her.Graphically it's very minimalistic but beautifully drawn. Not a lot to talk about graphics.No ultrawide for obvious reasons. Performance? No need to talk about it, if your PC can show pictures it will run this game.Music is really nice and it reflects the emotions your going through but I wish there would be a better transition when music changes.Get this if you appreciate art and interactive stories. The game is great but it's very short, sure it's only 5€ but i'd still suggest waiting for a sale.

The game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it.  What's inside? Story is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling.

People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.It paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that "routine" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.I liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters.

Bō / Toni	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055802307/	- Act I - Crush What to do on your sad Valentine's day, when you've canceled your own pity party and felt betrayed by your own feelings? Simple. To play the mobile game you've been hearing some good stuff about, which has been given a surprising Steam release. That's how I was introduced to Florence, anyway. I will skip that part of the game winning every possible award and beating all the best mobile games back when it was originally released. You most likely know that already. Besides, it's not that important. The feelings and experience are all that matters. As Maya Angelou famously said: I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. The same is fair for video games - you may forget many details about them, but you will always remember how some of them made you feel. And Florence? Quality emotions delivery service at the click of your mouse!  - Act II - Happy TogetherA wholesome and elegant mix of webcomic, puzzle game, and walking simulator elements will tell you a simple, ordinary even, story about day-to-day routine, escapism, dreams, first love, pain, inspiration, frustration, forgiveness. The story, relevant to many yet somewhat uniquely special for you. It's almost a self-help 'narrative' for your struggling adult life - although, I might have watched too many motivational youtube videos, so let's move on.Gameplay difficulty is at zero level, however, it's still quite enjoyable going through mini-games and being a part of interactive storytelling. Controls are quite simple, but I would recommend using your mouse, as it's more convenient (you will see why), but there's full controller support, if you prefer. Florence is unquestionably linear, but the illusion of choice and different interpretations of your own experience may give you something to ponder about at the end. I say: play it twice. The first time, when you are sad; the second time when you are happy. Test your emotions. Embrace the routine. Improve your St Valentine's Day.- Act III - RoutineOnce you beat the game, you'll have access to all the chapters separately, which is useful, if you want to go through all the achievements. It took me about an hour to complete 30 mins game which felt like a brief moment. I wanted more and I played it again. You know it's good when the time feels faster than it actually is. There are also rumors you can speedrun this game for ~15 mins, but I'm not even sure why I'm telling you this? Music also plays a significant role - it's quite lighthearted, but so on point and will dictate the swings of your mood. The original soundtrack is included, so you can listen to it anytime.- Act IV - The EndIn short: it's when simplicity beats everything. It is a simple yet beautiful experience, and after that short period of time with Florence you may forget the details, but you will remember how this game made you feel. Give it a try. Special thank you to the wonderful Samurai Punk team, who have ported this game to both PC & Switch and made this experience possible!  PS: Thank you all for reading - appreciate your time!

kgsizemo	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198202715070/	My girl does not like crust! ---- SPOILERS!!!! ---- First, let me say that the score for this game is phenomenal! O.k., now that I've addressed that aspect, I will continue with my take on the game's plot.This plot reminds me of one of my favorite movies, La La Land. Although they are technically love stories, both Florence and La La Land have this seemingly tragic element to them. The relationships do not last. This does not mean that the time spent in said relationships were wasted.In Florence's case, both characters were stuck in ruts before they met, just going through the day-to-day motions. Once they met, and eventually began dating, they started to open up and share their thoughts. Their passions. Because they both developed care and affection for each other, they each pushed one another to pursue said passions. If not for Florence, Krish would not have applied for the music academy; If not for Krish, Florence might not have chased her dream of becoming an artist.Both Florence and Krish set one another on a better path than they were on.While Florence and Krish did not end up together, both hugely impacted one another. This is not a sad story. Sometimes people come into your life only for a season... and it can be a beautiful season! Just because the relationship did not last, that does not mean the memories, lessons, or admiration for the other person has to end as well.This game is good. Check it out.

Bodomi	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bodomi/	Florence is an overpriced 30-minute short novel with an un-relatable, and in my opinion horrible story and extremely monotonous 'puzzles'/mini-games that feels like homework for a young child, matching geometrical shapes together and solving math problems like 8+?=16.What I grasp from the moral of story is that: moms are annoying, digital things are bad, anything but homemade cultural meals are negative, a stable relationship with routine is bad, and a good career change in your mid-20's is to start doing something you did as a toddler and never again after that.The art and music is really good but I don't give games positive reviews because they had a wonderful art-style and good soundtrack, unlike most of the people who have given this game a positive review.In the end it sucked. It was boring, the moral of the story was horrible and the last half of the game was just a bunch of fanciful nonsense that would never happen in reality.It's a banal and dull love story. It tries to be deep, but it really isn't.If the game was longer with a lot more detail on how the 2 main characters relationship developed and way more detail on how she continued her sudden artist career it could maybe be a mediocre thing and not a waste of money, but not this 30-minute crap story with a very sudden ending of her deciding to pursue an art career because she drew as a child, like 99% of all children in her shoes did.Curator pageIf you liked this review or otherwise found it helpful in deciding whether or not to buy this game, feel free to follow my Curator page.Edit: All of a sudden my Steam Curator page link is being censored in this review, shows up just fine in all my other reviews.Edit edit: And it's back, after several hours.Edit edit edit: And a few days ago the review was completely removed from the store page.

O.k., now that I've addressed that aspect, I will continue with my take on the game's plot.This plot reminds me of one of my favorite movies, La La Land. Although they are technically love stories, both Florence and La La Land have this seemingly tragic element to them. The relationships do not last. This does not mean that the time spent in said relationships were wasted.In Florence's case, both characters were stuck in ruts before they met, just going through the day-to-day motions. Once they met, and eventually began dating, they started to open up and share their thoughts. Their passions. Because they both developed care and affection for each other, they each pushed one another to pursue said passions. If not for Florence, Krish would not have applied for the music academy; If not for Krish, Florence might not have chased her dream of becoming an artist.Both Florence and Krish set one another on a better path than they were on.While Florence and Krish did not end up together, both hugely impacted one another. This is not a sad story. Sometimes people come into your life only for a season... and it can be a beautiful season!

Bodomi	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bodomi/	Florence is an overpriced 30-minute short novel with an un-relatable, and in my opinion horrible story and extremely monotonous 'puzzles'/mini-games that feels like homework for a young child, matching geometrical shapes together and solving math problems like 8+?=16.What I grasp from the moral of story is that: moms are annoying, digital things are bad, anything but homemade cultural meals are negative, a stable relationship with routine is bad, and a good career change in your mid-20's is to start doing something you did as a toddler and never again after that.The art and music is really good but I don't give games positive reviews because they had a wonderful art-style and good soundtrack, unlike most of the people who have given this game a positive review.In the end it sucked. It was boring, the moral of the story was horrible and the last half of the game was just a bunch of fanciful nonsense that would never happen in reality.It's a banal and dull love story. It tries to be deep, but it really isn't.If the game was longer with a lot more detail on how the 2 main characters relationship developed and way more detail on how she continued her sudden artist career it could maybe be a mediocre thing and not a waste of money, but not this 30-minute crap story with a very sudden ending of her deciding to pursue an art career because she drew as a child, like 99% of all children in her shoes did.Curator pageIf you liked this review or otherwise found it helpful in deciding whether or not to buy this game, feel free to follow my Curator page.Edit: All of a sudden my Steam Curator page link is being censored in this review, shows up just fine in all my other reviews.Edit edit: And it's back, after several hours.Edit edit edit: And a few days ago the review was completely removed from the store page.

Kosmozuikis	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kosmozuikis/	Sometimes simplicity is all you need, no words, no fancy graphics, just beautiful art to deliver a powerful messageFlorence is a very short interactive story of a girl and some stages of her life. It's simple, lasts only for about and hour but has a huge impact on you.The idea along with the artstyle is really neat. The whole gameplay is just scrolling through images sometimes doing simple tasks. But those tasks usually have a deeper meaning. There are some moving scenes, again with a meaning.It's a very heartwarming and maybe a little heartbreaking story but so is life. A lot of people will see themselves in this game, same stuff many people go through in their life.Sometimes you need a little push to go on. You make memories, you reminisce about the past, think about how life has changed and how you changed. Falling in love, getting to know that person which at first might seem difficult. Big hurtful words you say without thinking. All the hardships and joyful moments of your life.  But you need to remember even if everything falls down you can start painting your world with colors again. It's all there, represented through simple yet beautiful art. Puzzles (this part completely got me), coloring, walking, it's beautiful. I don't know what it is, but this game has something which triggers emotions and makes you think, maybe go to your partner and hug him/her, tell your mother you love her.Graphically it's very minimalistic but beautifully drawn. Not a lot to talk about graphics.No ultrawide for obvious reasons. Performance? No need to talk about it, if your PC can show pictures it will run this game.Music is really nice and it reflects the emotions your going through but I wish there would be a better transition when music changes.Get this if you appreciate art and interactive stories. The game is great but it's very short, sure it's only 5€ but i'd still suggest waiting for a sale.

EliteSpartanKiller906	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198346841484/	 Too much for too little? The game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it.  What's inside? Story is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling.  Conclusion I highly recommend this game for anyone with feeeels and without. It's short, but as they say it "packs a punch".

i_Go_SpLaT	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/i_Go_SpLaT/	Started strong, ended annoyingly.Moral of the story? People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.It paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that "routine" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.I liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.At least it was short. 
Bō / Toni	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055802307/	- Act I - Crush What to do on your sad Valentine's day, when you've canceled your own pity party and felt betrayed by your own feelings? Simple. To play the mobile game you've been hearing some good stuff about, which has been given a surprising Steam release. That's how I was introduced to Florence, anyway. I will skip that part of the game winning every possible award and beating all the best mobile games back when it was originally released. You most likely know that already. Besides, it's not that important. The feelings and experience are all that matters. As Maya Angelou famously said: I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. The same is fair for video games - you may forget many details about them, but you will always remember how some of them made you feel. And Florence? Quality emotions delivery service at the click of your mouse!  - Act II - Happy TogetherA wholesome and elegant mix of webcomic, puzzle game, and walking simulator elements will tell you a simple, ordinary even, story about day-to-day routine, escapism, dreams, first love, pain, inspiration, frustration, forgiveness. The story, relevant to many yet somewhat uniquely special for you. It's almost a self-help 'narrative' for your struggling adult life - although, I might have watched too many motivational youtube videos, so let's move on.Gameplay difficulty is at zero level, however, it's still quite enjoyable going through mini-games and being a part of interactive storytelling. Controls are quite simple, but I would recommend using your mouse, as it's more convenient (you will see why), but there's full controller support, if you prefer. Florence is unquestionably linear, but the illusion of choice and different interpretations of your own experience may give you something to ponder about at the end. I say: play it twice. The first time, when you are sad; the second time when you are happy. Test your emotions. Embrace the routine. Improve your St Valentine's Day.- Act III - RoutineOnce you beat the game, you'll have access to all the chapters separately, which is useful, if you want to go through all the achievements. It took me about an hour to complete 30 mins game which felt like a brief moment. I wanted more and I played it again. You know it's good when the time feels faster than it actually is. There are also rumors you can speedrun this game for ~15 mins, but I'm not even sure why I'm telling you this? Music also plays a significant role - it's quite lighthearted, but so on point and will dictate the swings of your mood. The original soundtrack is included, so you can listen to it anytime.- Act IV - The EndIn short: it's when simplicity beats everything. It is a simple yet beautiful experience, and after that short period of time with Florence you may forget the details, but you will remember how this game made you feel. Give it a try. Special thank you to the wonderful Samurai Punk team, who have ported this game to both PC & Switch and made this experience possible!  PS: Thank you all for reading - appreciate your time!

People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.It paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that "routine" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.I liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.At least it was short. 
Bō / Toni	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055802307/	- Act I - Crush What to do on your sad Valentine's day, when you've canceled your own pity party and felt betrayed by your own feelings? Simple. To play the mobile game you've been hearing some good stuff about, which has been given a surprising Steam release. That's how I was introduced to Florence, anyway. I will skip that part of the game winning every possible award and beating all the best mobile games back when it was originally released. You most likely know that already. Besides, it's not that important. The feelings and experience are all that matters. As Maya Angelou famously said: I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. The same is fair for video games - you may forget many details about them, but you will always remember how some of them made you feel. And Florence? Quality emotions delivery service at the click of your mouse!  - Act II - Happy TogetherA wholesome and elegant mix of webcomic, puzzle game, and walking simulator elements will tell you a simple, ordinary even, story about day-to-day routine, escapism, dreams, first love, pain, inspiration, frustration, forgiveness. The story, relevant to many yet somewhat uniquely special for you. It's almost a self-help 'narrative' for your struggling adult life - although, I might have watched too many motivational youtube videos, so let's move on.Gameplay difficulty is at zero level, however, it's still quite enjoyable going through mini-games and being a part of interactive storytelling. Controls are quite simple, but I would recommend using your mouse, as it's more convenient (you will see why), but there's full controller support, if you prefer. Florence is unquestionably linear, but the illusion of choice and different interpretations of your own experience may give you something to ponder about at the end. I say: play it twice. The first time, when you are sad; the second time when you are happy. Test your emotions. Embrace the routine. Improve your St Valentine's Day.- Act III - RoutineOnce you beat the game, you'll have access to all the chapters separately, which is useful, if you want to go through all the achievements. It took me about an hour to complete 30 mins game which felt like a brief moment. I wanted more and I played it again. You know it's good when the time feels faster than it actually is. There are also rumors you can speedrun this game for ~15 mins, but I'm not even sure why I'm telling you this? Music also plays a significant role - it's quite lighthearted, but so on point and will dictate the swings of your mood. The original soundtrack is included, so you can listen to it anytime.- Act IV - The EndIn short: it's when simplicity beats everything. It is a simple yet beautiful experience, and after that short period of time with Florence you may forget the details, but you will remember how this game made you feel. Give it a try. Special thank you to the wonderful Samurai Punk team, who have ported this game to both PC & Switch and made this experience possible!  PS: Thank you all for reading - appreciate your time! Much love ~

O.k., now that I've addressed that aspect, I will continue with my take on the game's plot.This plot reminds me of one of my favorite movies, La La Land. Although they are technically love stories, both Florence and La La Land have this seemingly tragic element to them. The relationships do not last. This does not mean that the time spent in said relationships were wasted.In Florence's case, both characters were stuck in ruts before they met, just going through the day-to-day motions. Once they met, and eventually began dating, they started to open up and share their thoughts. Their passions. Because they both developed care and affection for each other, they each pushed one another to pursue said passions. If not for Florence, Krish would not have applied for the music academy; If not for Krish, Florence might not have chased her dream of becoming an artist.Both Florence and Krish set one another on a better path than they were on.While Florence and Krish did not end up together, both hugely impacted one another. This is not a sad story. Sometimes people come into your life only for a season... and it can be a beautiful season! Just because the relationship did not last, that does not mean the memories, lessons, or admiration for the other person has to end as well.This game is good. Check it out.

Bodomi	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bodomi/	Florence is an overpriced 30-minute short novel with an un-relatable, and in my opinion horrible story and extremely monotonous 'puzzles'/mini-games that feels like homework for a young child, matching geometrical shapes together and solving math problems like 8+?=16.What I grasp from the moral of story is that: moms are annoying, digital things are bad, anything but homemade cultural meals are negative, a stable relationship with routine is bad, and a good career change in your mid-20's is to start doing something you did as a toddler and never again after that.The art and music is really good but I don't give games positive reviews because they had a wonderful art-style and good soundtrack, unlike most of the people who have given this game a positive review.In the end it sucked. It was boring, the moral of the story was horrible and the last half of the game was just a bunch of fanciful nonsense that would never happen in reality.It's a banal and dull love story. It tries to be deep, but it really isn't.If the game was longer with a lot more detail on how the 2 main characters relationship developed and way more detail on how she continued her sudden artist career it could maybe be a mediocre thing and not a waste of money, but not this 30-minute crap story with a very sudden ending of her deciding to pursue an art career because she drew as a child, like 99% of all children in her shoes did.Curator pageIf you liked this review or otherwise found it helpful in deciding whether or not to buy this game, feel free to follow my Curator page.Edit: All of a sudden my Steam Curator page link is being censored in this review, shows up just fine in all my other reviews.Edit edit: And it's back, after several hours.Edit edit edit: And a few days ago the review was completely removed from the store page.

Pros- +Great looking art style with visual storytelling that I never really expected. There were so many moments where I sat for a second like, hey that's actually really smart, mainly in regards to having conversations and such +Beautiful OST +Coming of age/relationship based story that I'm sure 99% of people can relate to. The story and pacing is really good, despite there being few words explicitly spoken through the whole gameCons--The game is rather short, which in an of itself isn't a big issue, I just wish we got to experience more of this story! It's difficult to say anything bad about this game, it's a short story-rich experience that can get you feeling all sorts of emotions. If that's your thing, you'll probably dig it!  Rating: 3.5/5 
Kosmozuikis	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kosmozuikis/	Sometimes simplicity is all you need, no words, no fancy graphics, just beautiful art to deliver a powerful messageFlorence is a very short interactive story of a girl and some stages of her life. It's simple, lasts only for about and hour but has a huge impact on you.The idea along with the artstyle is really neat. The whole gameplay is just scrolling through images sometimes doing simple tasks. But those tasks usually have a deeper meaning. There are some moving scenes, again with a meaning.It's a very heartwarming and maybe a little heartbreaking story but so is life. A lot of people will see themselves in this game, same stuff many people go through in their life.Sometimes you need a little push to go on. You make memories, you reminisce about the past, think about how life has changed and how you changed. Falling in love, getting to know that person which at first might seem difficult. Big hurtful words you say without thinking. All the hardships and joyful moments of your life.  But you need to remember even if everything falls down you can start painting your world with colors again. It's all there, represented through simple yet beautiful art. Puzzles (this part completely got me), coloring, walking, it's beautiful. I don't know what it is, but this game has something which triggers emotions and makes you think, maybe go to your partner and hug him/her, tell your mother you love her.Graphically it's very minimalistic but beautifully drawn. Not a lot to talk about graphics.No ultrawide for obvious reasons. Performance? No need to talk about it, if your PC can show pictures it will run this game.Music is really nice and it reflects the emotions your going through but I wish there would be a better transition when music changes.Get this if you appreciate art and interactive stories. The game is great but it's very short, sure it's only 5€ but i'd still suggest waiting for a sale. But hey at least it's not 20€ like Gone Home (loved it too btw, but the price...).ProsBeautiful artGood musicYour life on a plateConsCould be a little longerFollow my curator page for more 
EliteSpartanKiller906	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198346841484/	 Too much for too little? The game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it.  What's inside? Story is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling.  Conclusion I highly recommend this game for anyone with feeeels and without. It's short, but as they say it "packs a punch".

Kosmozuikis	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kosmozuikis/	Sometimes simplicity is all you need, no words, no fancy graphics, just beautiful art to deliver a powerful messageFlorence is a very short interactive story of a girl and some stages of her life. It's simple, lasts only for about and hour but has a huge impact on you.The idea along with the artstyle is really neat. The whole gameplay is just scrolling through images sometimes doing simple tasks. But those tasks usually have a deeper meaning. There are some moving scenes, again with a meaning.It's a very heartwarming and maybe a little heartbreaking story but so is life. A lot of people will see themselves in this game, same stuff many people go through in their life.Sometimes you need a little push to go on. You make memories, you reminisce about the past, think about how life has changed and how you changed. Falling in love, getting to know that person which at first might seem difficult. Big hurtful words you say without thinking. All the hardships and joyful moments of your life.  But you need to remember even if everything falls down you can start painting your world with colors again. It's all there, represented through simple yet beautiful art. Puzzles (this part completely got me), coloring, walking, it's beautiful. I don't know what it is, but this game has something which triggers emotions and makes you think, maybe go to your partner and hug him/her, tell your mother you love her.Graphically it's very minimalistic but beautifully drawn. Not a lot to talk about graphics.No ultrawide for obvious reasons. Performance? No need to talk about it, if your PC can show pictures it will run this game.Music is really nice and it reflects the emotions your going through but I wish there would be a better transition when music changes.Get this if you appreciate art and interactive stories. The game is great but it's very short, sure it's only 5€ but i'd still suggest waiting for a sale.

The game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it.  What's inside? Story is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling.

People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.It paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that "routine" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.I liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters.

Bō / Toni	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055802307/	- Act I - Crush What to do on your sad Valentine's day, when you've canceled your own pity party and felt betrayed by your own feelings? Simple. To play the mobile game you've been hearing some good stuff about, which has been given a surprising Steam release. That's how I was introduced to Florence, anyway. I will skip that part of the game winning every possible award and beating all the best mobile games back when it was originally released. You most likely know that already. Besides, it's not that important. The feelings and experience are all that matters. As Maya Angelou famously said: I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. The same is fair for video games - you may forget many details about them, but you will always remember how some of them made you feel. And Florence? Quality emotions delivery service at the click of your mouse!  - Act II - Happy TogetherA wholesome and elegant mix of webcomic, puzzle game, and walking simulator elements will tell you a simple, ordinary even, story about day-to-day routine, escapism, dreams, first love, pain, inspiration, frustration, forgiveness. The story, relevant to many yet somewhat uniquely special for you. It's almost a self-help 'narrative' for your struggling adult life - although, I might have watched too many motivational youtube videos, so let's move on.Gameplay difficulty is at zero level, however, it's still quite enjoyable going through mini-games and being a part of interactive storytelling. Controls are quite simple, but I would recommend using your mouse, as it's more convenient (you will see why), but there's full controller support, if you prefer. Florence is unquestionably linear, but the illusion of choice and different interpretations of your own experience may give you something to ponder about at the end. I say: play it twice. The first time, when you are sad; the second time when you are happy. Test your emotions. Embrace the routine. Improve your St Valentine's Day.- Act III - RoutineOnce you beat the game, you'll have access to all the chapters separately, which is useful, if you want to go through all the achievements. It took me about an hour to complete 30 mins game which felt like a brief moment. I wanted more and I played it again. You know it's good when the time feels faster than it actually is. There are also rumors you can speedrun this game for ~15 mins, but I'm not even sure why I'm telling you this? Music also plays a significant role - it's quite lighthearted, but so on point and will dictate the swings of your mood. The original soundtrack is included, so you can listen to it anytime.- Act IV - The EndIn short: it's when simplicity beats everything. It is a simple yet beautiful experience, and after that short period of time with Florence you may forget the details, but you will remember how this game made you feel. Give it a try. Special thank you to the wonderful Samurai Punk team, who have ported this game to both PC & Switch and made this experience possible!  PS: Thank you all for reading - appreciate your time!

kgsizemo	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198202715070/	My girl does not like crust! ---- SPOILERS!!!! ---- First, let me say that the score for this game is phenomenal! O.k., now that I've addressed that aspect, I will continue with my take on the game's plot.This plot reminds me of one of my favorite movies, La La Land. Although they are technically love stories, both Florence and La La Land have this seemingly tragic element to them. The relationships do not last. This does not mean that the time spent in said relationships were wasted.In Florence's case, both characters were stuck in ruts before they met, just going through the day-to-day motions. Once they met, and eventually began dating, they started to open up and share their thoughts. Their passions. Because they both developed care and affection for each other, they each pushed one another to pursue said passions. If not for Florence, Krish would not have applied for the music academy; If not for Krish, Florence might not have chased her dream of becoming an artist.Both Florence and Krish set one another on a better path than they were on.While Florence and Krish did not end up together, both hugely impacted one another. This is not a sad story. Sometimes people come into your life only for a season... and it can be a beautiful season! Just because the relationship did not last, that does not mean the memories, lessons, or admiration for the other person has to end as well.This game is good. Check it out.

Bodomi	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bodomi/	Florence is an overpriced 30-minute short novel with an un-relatable, and in my opinion horrible story and extremely monotonous 'puzzles'/mini-games that feels like homework for a young child, matching geometrical shapes together and solving math problems like 8+?=16.What I grasp from the moral of story is that: moms are annoying, digital things are bad, anything but homemade cultural meals are negative, a stable relationship with routine is bad, and a good career change in your mid-20's is to start doing something you did as a toddler and never again after that.The art and music is really good but I don't give games positive reviews because they had a wonderful art-style and good soundtrack, unlike most of the people who have given this game a positive review.In the end it sucked. It was boring, the moral of the story was horrible and the last half of the game was just a bunch of fanciful nonsense that would never happen in reality.It's a banal and dull love story. It tries to be deep, but it really isn't.If the game was longer with a lot more detail on how the 2 main characters relationship developed and way more detail on how she continued her sudden artist career it could maybe be a mediocre thing and not a waste of money, but not this 30-minute crap story with a very sudden ending of her deciding to pursue an art career because she drew as a child, like 99% of all children in her shoes did.Curator pageIf you liked this review or otherwise found it helpful in deciding whether or not to buy this game, feel free to follow my Curator page.Edit: All of a sudden my Steam Curator page link is being censored in this review, shows up just fine in all my other reviews.Edit edit: And it's back, after several hours.Edit edit edit: And a few days ago the review was completely removed from the store page.

O.k., now that I've addressed that aspect, I will continue with my take on the game's plot.This plot reminds me of one of my favorite movies, La La Land. Although they are technically love stories, both Florence and La La Land have this seemingly tragic element to them. The relationships do not last. This does not mean that the time spent in said relationships were wasted.In Florence's case, both characters were stuck in ruts before they met, just going through the day-to-day motions. Once they met, and eventually began dating, they started to open up and share their thoughts. Their passions. Because they both developed care and affection for each other, they each pushed one another to pursue said passions. If not for Florence, Krish would not have applied for the music academy; If not for Krish, Florence might not have chased her dream of becoming an artist.Both Florence and Krish set one another on a better path than they were on.While Florence and Krish did not end up together, both hugely impacted one another. This is not a sad story. Sometimes people come into your life only for a season... and it can be a beautiful season!

Bodomi	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bodomi/	Florence is an overpriced 30-minute short novel with an un-relatable, and in my opinion horrible story and extremely monotonous 'puzzles'/mini-games that feels like homework for a young child, matching geometrical shapes together and solving math problems like 8+?=16.What I grasp from the moral of story is that: moms are annoying, digital things are bad, anything but homemade cultural meals are negative, a stable relationship with routine is bad, and a good career change in your mid-20's is to start doing something you did as a toddler and never again after that.The art and music is really good but I don't give games positive reviews because they had a wonderful art-style and good soundtrack, unlike most of the people who have given this game a positive review.In the end it sucked. It was boring, the moral of the story was horrible and the last half of the game was just a bunch of fanciful nonsense that would never happen in reality.It's a banal and dull love story. It tries to be deep, but it really isn't.If the game was longer with a lot more detail on how the 2 main characters relationship developed and way more detail on how she continued her sudden artist career it could maybe be a mediocre thing and not a waste of money, but not this 30-minute crap story with a very sudden ending of her deciding to pursue an art career because she drew as a child, like 99% of all children in her shoes did.Curator pageIf you liked this review or otherwise found it helpful in deciding whether or not to buy this game, feel free to follow my Curator page.Edit: All of a sudden my Steam Curator page link is being censored in this review, shows up just fine in all my other reviews.Edit edit: And it's back, after several hours.Edit edit edit: And a few days ago the review was completely removed from the store page.

Kosmozuikis	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kosmozuikis/	Sometimes simplicity is all you need, no words, no fancy graphics, just beautiful art to deliver a powerful messageFlorence is a very short interactive story of a girl and some stages of her life. It's simple, lasts only for about and hour but has a huge impact on you.The idea along with the artstyle is really neat. The whole gameplay is just scrolling through images sometimes doing simple tasks. But those tasks usually have a deeper meaning. There are some moving scenes, again with a meaning.It's a very heartwarming and maybe a little heartbreaking story but so is life. A lot of people will see themselves in this game, same stuff many people go through in their life.Sometimes you need a little push to go on. You make memories, you reminisce about the past, think about how life has changed and how you changed. Falling in love, getting to know that person which at first might seem difficult. Big hurtful words you say without thinking. All the hardships and joyful moments of your life.  But you need to remember even if everything falls down you can start painting your world with colors again. It's all there, represented through simple yet beautiful art. Puzzles (this part completely got me), coloring, walking, it's beautiful. I don't know what it is, but this game has something which triggers emotions and makes you think, maybe go to your partner and hug him/her, tell your mother you love her.Graphically it's very minimalistic but beautifully drawn. Not a lot to talk about graphics.No ultrawide for obvious reasons. Performance? No need to talk about it, if your PC can show pictures it will run this game.Music is really nice and it reflects the emotions your going through but I wish there would be a better transition when music changes.Get this if you appreciate art and interactive stories. The game is great but it's very short, sure it's only 5€ but i'd still suggest waiting for a sale.

EliteSpartanKiller906	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198346841484/	 Too much for too little? The game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it.  What's inside? Story is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling.  Conclusion I highly recommend this game for anyone with feeeels and without. It's short, but as they say it "packs a punch".

i_Go_SpLaT	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/i_Go_SpLaT/	Started strong, ended annoyingly.Moral of the story? People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.It paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that "routine" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.I liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.At least it was short. 
Bō / Toni	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055802307/	- Act I - Crush What to do on your sad Valentine's day, when you've canceled your own pity party and felt betrayed by your own feelings? Simple. To play the mobile game you've been hearing some good stuff about, which has been given a surprising Steam release. That's how I was introduced to Florence, anyway. I will skip that part of the game winning every possible award and beating all the best mobile games back when it was originally released. You most likely know that already. Besides, it's not that important. The feelings and experience are all that matters. As Maya Angelou famously said: I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. The same is fair for video games - you may forget many details about them, but you will always remember how some of them made you feel. And Florence? Quality emotions delivery service at the click of your mouse!  - Act II - Happy TogetherA wholesome and elegant mix of webcomic, puzzle game, and walking simulator elements will tell you a simple, ordinary even, story about day-to-day routine, escapism, dreams, first love, pain, inspiration, frustration, forgiveness. The story, relevant to many yet somewhat uniquely special for you. It's almost a self-help 'narrative' for your struggling adult life - although, I might have watched too many motivational youtube videos, so let's move on.Gameplay difficulty is at zero level, however, it's still quite enjoyable going through mini-games and being a part of interactive storytelling. Controls are quite simple, but I would recommend using your mouse, as it's more convenient (you will see why), but there's full controller support, if you prefer. Florence is unquestionably linear, but the illusion of choice and different interpretations of your own experience may give you something to ponder about at the end. I say: play it twice. The first time, when you are sad; the second time when you are happy. Test your emotions. Embrace the routine. Improve your St Valentine's Day.- Act III - RoutineOnce you beat the game, you'll have access to all the chapters separately, which is useful, if you want to go through all the achievements. It took me about an hour to complete 30 mins game which felt like a brief moment. I wanted more and I played it again. You know it's good when the time feels faster than it actually is. There are also rumors you can speedrun this game for ~15 mins, but I'm not even sure why I'm telling you this? Music also plays a significant role - it's quite lighthearted, but so on point and will dictate the swings of your mood. The original soundtrack is included, so you can listen to it anytime.- Act IV - The EndIn short: it's when simplicity beats everything. It is a simple yet beautiful experience, and after that short period of time with Florence you may forget the details, but you will remember how this game made you feel. Give it a try. Special thank you to the wonderful Samurai Punk team, who have ported this game to both PC & Switch and made this experience possible!  PS: Thank you all for reading - appreciate your time!

People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.It paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that "routine" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.I liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.At least it was short. 
Bō / Toni	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055802307/	- Act I - Crush What to do on your sad Valentine's day, when you've canceled your own pity party and felt betrayed by your own feelings? Simple. To play the mobile game you've been hearing some good stuff about, which has been given a surprising Steam release. That's how I was introduced to Florence, anyway. I will skip that part of the game winning every possible award and beating all the best mobile games back when it was originally released. You most likely know that already. Besides, it's not that important. The feelings and experience are all that matters. As Maya Angelou famously said: I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. The same is fair for video games - you may forget many details about them, but you will always remember how some of them made you feel. And Florence? Quality emotions delivery service at the click of your mouse!  - Act II - Happy TogetherA wholesome and elegant mix of webcomic, puzzle game, and walking simulator elements will tell you a simple, ordinary even, story about day-to-day routine, escapism, dreams, first love, pain, inspiration, frustration, forgiveness. The story, relevant to many yet somewhat uniquely special for you. It's almost a self-help 'narrative' for your struggling adult life - although, I might have watched too many motivational youtube videos, so let's move on.Gameplay difficulty is at zero level, however, it's still quite enjoyable going through mini-games and being a part of interactive storytelling. Controls are quite simple, but I would recommend using your mouse, as it's more convenient (you will see why), but there's full controller support, if you prefer. Florence is unquestionably linear, but the illusion of choice and different interpretations of your own experience may give you something to ponder about at the end. I say: play it twice. The first time, when you are sad; the second time when you are happy. Test your emotions. Embrace the routine. Improve your St Valentine's Day.- Act III - RoutineOnce you beat the game, you'll have access to all the chapters separately, which is useful, if you want to go through all the achievements. It took me about an hour to complete 30 mins game which felt like a brief moment. I wanted more and I played it again. You know it's good when the time feels faster than it actually is. There are also rumors you can speedrun this game for ~15 mins, but I'm not even sure why I'm telling you this? Music also plays a significant role - it's quite lighthearted, but so on point and will dictate the swings of your mood. The original soundtrack is included, so you can listen to it anytime.- Act IV - The EndIn short: it's when simplicity beats everything. It is a simple yet beautiful experience, and after that short period of time with Florence you may forget the details, but you will remember how this game made you feel. Give it a try. Special thank you to the wonderful Samurai Punk team, who have ported this game to both PC & Switch and made this experience possible!  PS: Thank you all for reading - appreciate your time! Much love ~

O.k., now that I've addressed that aspect, I will continue with my take on the game's plot.This plot reminds me of one of my favorite movies, La La Land. Although they are technically love stories, both Florence and La La Land have this seemingly tragic element to them. The relationships do not last. This does not mean that the time spent in said relationships were wasted.In Florence's case, both characters were stuck in ruts before they met, just going through the day-to-day motions. Once they met, and eventually began dating, they started to open up and share their thoughts. Their passions. Because they both developed care and affection for each other, they each pushed one another to pursue said passions. If not for Florence, Krish would not have applied for the music academy; If not for Krish, Florence might not have chased her dream of becoming an artist.Both Florence and Krish set one another on a better path than they were on.While Florence and Krish did not end up together, both hugely impacted one another. This is not a sad story. Sometimes people come into your life only for a season... and it can be a beautiful season! Just because the relationship did not last, that does not mean the memories, lessons, or admiration for the other person has to end as well.This game is good. Check it out.

Bodomi	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bodomi/	Florence is an overpriced 30-minute short novel with an un-relatable, and in my opinion horrible story and extremely monotonous 'puzzles'/mini-games that feels like homework for a young child, matching geometrical shapes together and solving math problems like 8+?=16.What I grasp from the moral of story is that: moms are annoying, digital things are bad, anything but homemade cultural meals are negative, a stable relationship with routine is bad, and a good career change in your mid-20's is to start doing something you did as a toddler and never again after that.The art and music is really good but I don't give games positive reviews because they had a wonderful art-style and good soundtrack, unlike most of the people who have given this game a positive review.In the end it sucked. It was boring, the moral of the story was horrible and the last half of the game was just a bunch of fanciful nonsense that would never happen in reality.It's a banal and dull love story. It tries to be deep, but it really isn't.If the game was longer with a lot more detail on how the 2 main characters relationship developed and way more detail on how she continued her sudden artist career it could maybe be a mediocre thing and not a waste of money, but not this 30-minute crap story with a very sudden ending of her deciding to pursue an art career because she drew as a child, like 99% of all children in her shoes did.Curator pageIf you liked this review or otherwise found it helpful in deciding whether or not to buy this game, feel free to follow my Curator page.Edit: All of a sudden my Steam Curator page link is being censored in this review, shows up just fine in all my other reviews.Edit edit: And it's back, after several hours.Edit edit edit: And a few days ago the review was completely removed from the store page.

Pros- +Great looking art style with visual storytelling that I never really expected. There were so many moments where I sat for a second like, hey that's actually really smart, mainly in regards to having conversations and such +Beautiful OST +Coming of age/relationship based story that I'm sure 99% of people can relate to. The story and pacing is really good, despite there being few words explicitly spoken through the whole gameCons--The game is rather short, which in an of itself isn't a big issue, I just wish we got to experience more of this story! It's difficult to say anything bad about this game, it's a short story-rich experience that can get you feeling all sorts of emotions. If that's your thing, you'll probably dig it!  Rating: 3.5/5 
Kosmozuikis	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kosmozuikis/	Sometimes simplicity is all you need, no words, no fancy graphics, just beautiful art to deliver a powerful messageFlorence is a very short interactive story of a girl and some stages of her life. It's simple, lasts only for about and hour but has a huge impact on you.The idea along with the artstyle is really neat. The whole gameplay is just scrolling through images sometimes doing simple tasks. But those tasks usually have a deeper meaning. There are some moving scenes, again with a meaning.It's a very heartwarming and maybe a little heartbreaking story but so is life. A lot of people will see themselves in this game, same stuff many people go through in their life.Sometimes you need a little push to go on. You make memories, you reminisce about the past, think about how life has changed and how you changed. Falling in love, getting to know that person which at first might seem difficult. Big hurtful words you say without thinking. All the hardships and joyful moments of your life.  But you need to remember even if everything falls down you can start painting your world with colors again. It's all there, represented through simple yet beautiful art. Puzzles (this part completely got me), coloring, walking, it's beautiful. I don't know what it is, but this game has something which triggers emotions and makes you think, maybe go to your partner and hug him/her, tell your mother you love her.Graphically it's very minimalistic but beautifully drawn. Not a lot to talk about graphics.No ultrawide for obvious reasons. Performance? No need to talk about it, if your PC can show pictures it will run this game.Music is really nice and it reflects the emotions your going through but I wish there would be a better transition when music changes.Get this if you appreciate art and interactive stories. The game is great but it's very short, sure it's only 5€ but i'd still suggest waiting for a sale. But hey at least it's not 20€ like Gone Home (loved it too btw, but the price...).ProsBeautiful artGood musicYour life on a plateConsCould be a little longerFollow my curator page for more 
EliteSpartanKiller906	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198346841484/	 Too much for too little? The game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it.  What's inside? Story is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling.  Conclusion I highly recommend this game for anyone with feeeels and without. It's short, but as they say it "packs a punch".

Kosmozuikis	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kosmozuikis/	Sometimes simplicity is all you need, no words, no fancy graphics, just beautiful art to deliver a powerful messageFlorence is a very short interactive story of a girl and some stages of her life. It's simple, lasts only for about and hour but has a huge impact on you.The idea along with the artstyle is really neat. The whole gameplay is just scrolling through images sometimes doing simple tasks. But those tasks usually have a deeper meaning. There are some moving scenes, again with a meaning.It's a very heartwarming and maybe a little heartbreaking story but so is life. A lot of people will see themselves in this game, same stuff many people go through in their life.Sometimes you need a little push to go on. You make memories, you reminisce about the past, think about how life has changed and how you changed. Falling in love, getting to know that person which at first might seem difficult. Big hurtful words you say without thinking. All the hardships and joyful moments of your life.  But you need to remember even if everything falls down you can start painting your world with colors again. It's all there, represented through simple yet beautiful art. Puzzles (this part completely got me), coloring, walking, it's beautiful. I don't know what it is, but this game has something which triggers emotions and makes you think, maybe go to your partner and hug him/her, tell your mother you love her.Graphically it's very minimalistic but beautifully drawn. Not a lot to talk about graphics.No ultrawide for obvious reasons. Performance? No need to talk about it, if your PC can show pictures it will run this game.Music is really nice and it reflects the emotions your going through but I wish there would be a better transition when music changes.Get this if you appreciate art and interactive stories. The game is great but it's very short, sure it's only 5€ but i'd still suggest waiting for a sale.

The game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it.  What's inside? Story is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling.

People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.It paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that "routine" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.I liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters.

Bō / Toni	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055802307/	- Act I - Crush What to do on your sad Valentine's day, when you've canceled your own pity party and felt betrayed by your own feelings? Simple. To play the mobile game you've been hearing some good stuff about, which has been given a surprising Steam release. That's how I was introduced to Florence, anyway. I will skip that part of the game winning every possible award and beating all the best mobile games back when it was originally released. You most likely know that already. Besides, it's not that important. The feelings and experience are all that matters. As Maya Angelou famously said: I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. The same is fair for video games - you may forget many details about them, but you will always remember how some of them made you feel. And Florence? Quality emotions delivery service at the click of your mouse!  - Act II - Happy TogetherA wholesome and elegant mix of webcomic, puzzle game, and walking simulator elements will tell you a simple, ordinary even, story about day-to-day routine, escapism, dreams, first love, pain, inspiration, frustration, forgiveness. The story, relevant to many yet somewhat uniquely special for you. It's almost a self-help 'narrative' for your struggling adult life - although, I might have watched too many motivational youtube videos, so let's move on.Gameplay difficulty is at zero level, however, it's still quite enjoyable going through mini-games and being a part of interactive storytelling. Controls are quite simple, but I would recommend using your mouse, as it's more convenient (you will see why), but there's full controller support, if you prefer. Florence is unquestionably linear, but the illusion of choice and different interpretations of your own experience may give you something to ponder about at the end. I say: play it twice. The first time, when you are sad; the second time when you are happy. Test your emotions. Embrace the routine. Improve your St Valentine's Day.- Act III - RoutineOnce you beat the game, you'll have access to all the chapters separately, which is useful, if you want to go through all the achievements. It took me about an hour to complete 30 mins game which felt like a brief moment. I wanted more and I played it again. You know it's good when the time feels faster than it actually is. There are also rumors you can speedrun this game for ~15 mins, but I'm not even sure why I'm telling you this? Music also plays a significant role - it's quite lighthearted, but so on point and will dictate the swings of your mood. The original soundtrack is included, so you can listen to it anytime.- Act IV - The EndIn short: it's when simplicity beats everything. It is a simple yet beautiful experience, and after that short period of time with Florence you may forget the details, but you will remember how this game made you feel. Give it a try. Special thank you to the wonderful Samurai Punk team, who have ported this game to both PC & Switch and made this experience possible!  PS: Thank you all for reading - appreciate your time!

kgsizemo	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198202715070/	My girl does not like crust! ---- SPOILERS!!!! ---- First, let me say that the score for this game is phenomenal! O.k., now that I've addressed that aspect, I will continue with my take on the game's plot.This plot reminds me of one of my favorite movies, La La Land. Although they are technically love stories, both Florence and La La Land have this seemingly tragic element to them. The relationships do not last. This does not mean that the time spent in said relationships were wasted.In Florence's case, both characters were stuck in ruts before they met, just going through the day-to-day motions. Once they met, and eventually began dating, they started to open up and share their thoughts. Their passions. Because they both developed care and affection for each other, they each pushed one another to pursue said passions. If not for Florence, Krish would not have applied for the music academy; If not for Krish, Florence might not have chased her dream of becoming an artist.Both Florence and Krish set one another on a better path than they were on.While Florence and Krish did not end up together, both hugely impacted one another. This is not a sad story. Sometimes people come into your life only for a season... and it can be a beautiful season! Just because the relationship did not last, that does not mean the memories, lessons, or admiration for the other person has to end as well.This game is good. Check it out.

Bodomi	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bodomi/	Florence is an overpriced 30-minute short novel with an un-relatable, and in my opinion horrible story and extremely monotonous 'puzzles'/mini-games that feels like homework for a young child, matching geometrical shapes together and solving math problems like 8+?=16.What I grasp from the moral of story is that: moms are annoying, digital things are bad, anything but homemade cultural meals are negative, a stable relationship with routine is bad, and a good career change in your mid-20's is to start doing something you did as a toddler and never again after that.The art and music is really good but I don't give games positive reviews because they had a wonderful art-style and good soundtrack, unlike most of the people who have given this game a positive review.In the end it sucked. It was boring, the moral of the story was horrible and the last half of the game was just a bunch of fanciful nonsense that would never happen in reality.It's a banal and dull love story. It tries to be deep, but it really isn't.If the game was longer with a lot more detail on how the 2 main characters relationship developed and way more detail on how she continued her sudden artist career it could maybe be a mediocre thing and not a waste of money, but not this 30-minute crap story with a very sudden ending of her deciding to pursue an art career because she drew as a child, like 99% of all children in her shoes did.Curator pageIf you liked this review or otherwise found it helpful in deciding whether or not to buy this game, feel free to follow my Curator page.Edit: All of a sudden my Steam Curator page link is being censored in this review, shows up just fine in all my other reviews.Edit edit: And it's back, after several hours.Edit edit edit: And a few days ago the review was completely removed from the store page.

O.k., now that I've addressed that aspect, I will continue with my take on the game's plot.This plot reminds me of one of my favorite movies, La La Land. Although they are technically love stories, both Florence and La La Land have this seemingly tragic element to them. The relationships do not last. This does not mean that the time spent in said relationships were wasted.In Florence's case, both characters were stuck in ruts before they met, just going through the day-to-day motions. Once they met, and eventually began dating, they started to open up and share their thoughts. Their passions. Because they both developed care and affection for each other, they each pushed one another to pursue said passions. If not for Florence, Krish would not have applied for the music academy; If not for Krish, Florence might not have chased her dream of becoming an artist.Both Florence and Krish set one another on a better path than they were on.While Florence and Krish did not end up together, both hugely impacted one another. This is not a sad story. Sometimes people come into your life only for a season... and it can be a beautiful season!

Bodomi	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bodomi/	Florence is an overpriced 30-minute short novel with an un-relatable, and in my opinion horrible story and extremely monotonous 'puzzles'/mini-games that feels like homework for a young child, matching geometrical shapes together and solving math problems like 8+?=16.What I grasp from the moral of story is that: moms are annoying, digital things are bad, anything but homemade cultural meals are negative, a stable relationship with routine is bad, and a good career change in your mid-20's is to start doing something you did as a toddler and never again after that.The art and music is really good but I don't give games positive reviews because they had a wonderful art-style and good soundtrack, unlike most of the people who have given this game a positive review.In the end it sucked. It was boring, the moral of the story was horrible and the last half of the game was just a bunch of fanciful nonsense that would never happen in reality.It's a banal and dull love story. It tries to be deep, but it really isn't.If the game was longer with a lot more detail on how the 2 main characters relationship developed and way more detail on how she continued her sudden artist career it could maybe be a mediocre thing and not a waste of money, but not this 30-minute crap story with a very sudden ending of her deciding to pursue an art career because she drew as a child, like 99% of all children in her shoes did.Curator pageIf you liked this review or otherwise found it helpful in deciding whether or not to buy this game, feel free to follow my Curator page.Edit: All of a sudden my Steam Curator page link is being censored in this review, shows up just fine in all my other reviews.Edit edit: And it's back, after several hours.Edit edit edit: And a few days ago the review was completely removed from the store page.

Kosmozuikis	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kosmozuikis/	Sometimes simplicity is all you need, no words, no fancy graphics, just beautiful art to deliver a powerful messageFlorence is a very short interactive story of a girl and some stages of her life. It's simple, lasts only for about and hour but has a huge impact on you.The idea along with the artstyle is really neat. The whole gameplay is just scrolling through images sometimes doing simple tasks. But those tasks usually have a deeper meaning. There are some moving scenes, again with a meaning.It's a very heartwarming and maybe a little heartbreaking story but so is life. A lot of people will see themselves in this game, same stuff many people go through in their life.Sometimes you need a little push to go on. You make memories, you reminisce about the past, think about how life has changed and how you changed. Falling in love, getting to know that person which at first might seem difficult. Big hurtful words you say without thinking. All the hardships and joyful moments of your life.  But you need to remember even if everything falls down you can start painting your world with colors again. It's all there, represented through simple yet beautiful art. Puzzles (this part completely got me), coloring, walking, it's beautiful. I don't know what it is, but this game has something which triggers emotions and makes you think, maybe go to your partner and hug him/her, tell your mother you love her.Graphically it's very minimalistic but beautifully drawn. Not a lot to talk about graphics.No ultrawide for obvious reasons. Performance? No need to talk about it, if your PC can show pictures it will run this game.Music is really nice and it reflects the emotions your going through but I wish there would be a better transition when music changes.Get this if you appreciate art and interactive stories. The game is great but it's very short, sure it's only 5€ but i'd still suggest waiting for a sale.

EliteSpartanKiller906	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198346841484/	 Too much for too little? The game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it.  What's inside? Story is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling.  Conclusion I highly recommend this game for anyone with feeeels and without. It's short, but as they say it "packs a punch".

i_Go_SpLaT	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/i_Go_SpLaT/	Started strong, ended annoyingly.Moral of the story? People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.It paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that "routine" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.I liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.At least it was short. 
Bō / Toni	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055802307/	- Act I - Crush What to do on your sad Valentine's day, when you've canceled your own pity party and felt betrayed by your own feelings? Simple. To play the mobile game you've been hearing some good stuff about, which has been given a surprising Steam release. That's how I was introduced to Florence, anyway. I will skip that part of the game winning every possible award and beating all the best mobile games back when it was originally released. You most likely know that already. Besides, it's not that important. The feelings and experience are all that matters. As Maya Angelou famously said: I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. The same is fair for video games - you may forget many details about them, but you will always remember how some of them made you feel. And Florence? Quality emotions delivery service at the click of your mouse!  - Act II - Happy TogetherA wholesome and elegant mix of webcomic, puzzle game, and walking simulator elements will tell you a simple, ordinary even, story about day-to-day routine, escapism, dreams, first love, pain, inspiration, frustration, forgiveness. The story, relevant to many yet somewhat uniquely special for you. It's almost a self-help 'narrative' for your struggling adult life - although, I might have watched too many motivational youtube videos, so let's move on.Gameplay difficulty is at zero level, however, it's still quite enjoyable going through mini-games and being a part of interactive storytelling. Controls are quite simple, but I would recommend using your mouse, as it's more convenient (you will see why), but there's full controller support, if you prefer. Florence is unquestionably linear, but the illusion of choice and different interpretations of your own experience may give you something to ponder about at the end. I say: play it twice. The first time, when you are sad; the second time when you are happy. Test your emotions. Embrace the routine. Improve your St Valentine's Day.- Act III - RoutineOnce you beat the game, you'll have access to all the chapters separately, which is useful, if you want to go through all the achievements. It took me about an hour to complete 30 mins game which felt like a brief moment. I wanted more and I played it again. You know it's good when the time feels faster than it actually is. There are also rumors you can speedrun this game for ~15 mins, but I'm not even sure why I'm telling you this? Music also plays a significant role - it's quite lighthearted, but so on point and will dictate the swings of your mood. The original soundtrack is included, so you can listen to it anytime.- Act IV - The EndIn short: it's when simplicity beats everything. It is a simple yet beautiful experience, and after that short period of time with Florence you may forget the details, but you will remember how this game made you feel. Give it a try. Special thank you to the wonderful Samurai Punk team, who have ported this game to both PC & Switch and made this experience possible!  PS: Thank you all for reading - appreciate your time!

People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.It paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that "routine" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.I liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.At least it was short. 
Bō / Toni	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055802307/	- Act I - Crush What to do on your sad Valentine's day, when you've canceled your own pity party and felt betrayed by your own feelings? Simple. To play the mobile game you've been hearing some good stuff about, which has been given a surprising Steam release. That's how I was introduced to Florence, anyway. I will skip that part of the game winning every possible award and beating all the best mobile games back when it was originally released. You most likely know that already. Besides, it's not that important. The feelings and experience are all that matters. As Maya Angelou famously said: I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. The same is fair for video games - you may forget many details about them, but you will always remember how some of them made you feel. And Florence? Quality emotions delivery service at the click of your mouse!  - Act II - Happy TogetherA wholesome and elegant mix of webcomic, puzzle game, and walking simulator elements will tell you a simple, ordinary even, story about day-to-day routine, escapism, dreams, first love, pain, inspiration, frustration, forgiveness. The story, relevant to many yet somewhat uniquely special for you. It's almost a self-help 'narrative' for your struggling adult life - although, I might have watched too many motivational youtube videos, so let's move on.Gameplay difficulty is at zero level, however, it's still quite enjoyable going through mini-games and being a part of interactive storytelling. Controls are quite simple, but I would recommend using your mouse, as it's more convenient (you will see why), but there's full controller support, if you prefer. Florence is unquestionably linear, but the illusion of choice and different interpretations of your own experience may give you something to ponder about at the end. I say: play it twice. The first time, when you are sad; the second time when you are happy. Test your emotions. Embrace the routine. Improve your St Valentine's Day.- Act III - RoutineOnce you beat the game, you'll have access to all the chapters separately, which is useful, if you want to go through all the achievements. It took me about an hour to complete 30 mins game which felt like a brief moment. I wanted more and I played it again. You know it's good when the time feels faster than it actually is. There are also rumors you can speedrun this game for ~15 mins, but I'm not even sure why I'm telling you this? Music also plays a significant role - it's quite lighthearted, but so on point and will dictate the swings of your mood. The original soundtrack is included, so you can listen to it anytime.- Act IV - The EndIn short: it's when simplicity beats everything. It is a simple yet beautiful experience, and after that short period of time with Florence you may forget the details, but you will remember how this game made you feel. Give it a try. Special thank you to the wonderful Samurai Punk team, who have ported this game to both PC & Switch and made this experience possible!  PS: Thank you all for reading - appreciate your time! Much love ~

O.k., now that I've addressed that aspect, I will continue with my take on the game's plot.This plot reminds me of one of my favorite movies, La La Land. Although they are technically love stories, both Florence and La La Land have this seemingly tragic element to them. The relationships do not last. This does not mean that the time spent in said relationships were wasted.In Florence's case, both characters were stuck in ruts before they met, just going through the day-to-day motions. Once they met, and eventually began dating, they started to open up and share their thoughts. Their passions. Because they both developed care and affection for each other, they each pushed one another to pursue said passions. If not for Florence, Krish would not have applied for the music academy; If not for Krish, Florence might not have chased her dream of becoming an artist.Both Florence and Krish set one another on a better path than they were on.While Florence and Krish did not end up together, both hugely impacted one another. This is not a sad story. Sometimes people come into your life only for a season... and it can be a beautiful season! Just because the relationship did not last, that does not mean the memories, lessons, or admiration for the other person has to end as well.This game is good. Check it out.

Bodomi	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bodomi/	Florence is an overpriced 30-minute short novel with an un-relatable, and in my opinion horrible story and extremely monotonous 'puzzles'/mini-games that feels like homework for a young child, matching geometrical shapes together and solving math problems like 8+?=16.What I grasp from the moral of story is that: moms are annoying, digital things are bad, anything but homemade cultural meals are negative, a stable relationship with routine is bad, and a good career change in your mid-20's is to start doing something you did as a toddler and never again after that.The art and music is really good but I don't give games positive reviews because they had a wonderful art-style and good soundtrack, unlike most of the people who have given this game a positive review.In the end it sucked. It was boring, the moral of the story was horrible and the last half of the game was just a bunch of fanciful nonsense that would never happen in reality.It's a banal and dull love story. It tries to be deep, but it really isn't.If the game was longer with a lot more detail on how the 2 main characters relationship developed and way more detail on how she continued her sudden artist career it could maybe be a mediocre thing and not a waste of money, but not this 30-minute crap story with a very sudden ending of her deciding to pursue an art career because she drew as a child, like 99% of all children in her shoes did.Curator pageIf you liked this review or otherwise found it helpful in deciding whether or not to buy this game, feel free to follow my Curator page.Edit: All of a sudden my Steam Curator page link is being censored in this review, shows up just fine in all my other reviews.Edit edit: And it's back, after several hours.Edit edit edit: And a few days ago the review was completely removed from the store page.

Pros- +Great looking art style with visual storytelling that I never really expected. There were so many moments where I sat for a second like, hey that's actually really smart, mainly in regards to having conversations and such +Beautiful OST +Coming of age/relationship based story that I'm sure 99% of people can relate to. The story and pacing is really good, despite there being few words explicitly spoken through the whole gameCons--The game is rather short, which in an of itself isn't a big issue, I just wish we got to experience more of this story! It's difficult to say anything bad about this game, it's a short story-rich experience that can get you feeling all sorts of emotions. If that's your thing, you'll probably dig it!  Rating: 3.5/5 
Kosmozuikis	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kosmozuikis/	Sometimes simplicity is all you need, no words, no fancy graphics, just beautiful art to deliver a powerful messageFlorence is a very short interactive story of a girl and some stages of her life. It's simple, lasts only for about and hour but has a huge impact on you.The idea along with the artstyle is really neat. The whole gameplay is just scrolling through images sometimes doing simple tasks. But those tasks usually have a deeper meaning. There are some moving scenes, again with a meaning.It's a very heartwarming and maybe a little heartbreaking story but so is life. A lot of people will see themselves in this game, same stuff many people go through in their life.Sometimes you need a little push to go on. You make memories, you reminisce about the past, think about how life has changed and how you changed. Falling in love, getting to know that person which at first might seem difficult. Big hurtful words you say without thinking. All the hardships and joyful moments of your life.  But you need to remember even if everything falls down you can start painting your world with colors again. It's all there, represented through simple yet beautiful art. Puzzles (this part completely got me), coloring, walking, it's beautiful. I don't know what it is, but this game has something which triggers emotions and makes you think, maybe go to your partner and hug him/her, tell your mother you love her.Graphically it's very minimalistic but beautifully drawn. Not a lot to talk about graphics.No ultrawide for obvious reasons. Performance? No need to talk about it, if your PC can show pictures it will run this game.Music is really nice and it reflects the emotions your going through but I wish there would be a better transition when music changes.Get this if you appreciate art and interactive stories. The game is great but it's very short, sure it's only 5€ but i'd still suggest waiting for a sale. But hey at least it's not 20€ like Gone Home (loved it too btw, but the price...).ProsBeautiful artGood musicYour life on a plateConsCould be a little longerFollow my curator page for more 
EliteSpartanKiller906	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198346841484/	 Too much for too little? The game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it.  What's inside? Story is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling.  Conclusion I highly recommend this game for anyone with feeeels and without. It's short, but as they say it "packs a punch".

Kosmozuikis	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kosmozuikis/	Sometimes simplicity is all you need, no words, no fancy graphics, just beautiful art to deliver a powerful messageFlorence is a very short interactive story of a girl and some stages of her life. It's simple, lasts only for about and hour but has a huge impact on you.The idea along with the artstyle is really neat. The whole gameplay is just scrolling through images sometimes doing simple tasks. But those tasks usually have a deeper meaning. There are some moving scenes, again with a meaning.It's a very heartwarming and maybe a little heartbreaking story but so is life. A lot of people will see themselves in this game, same stuff many people go through in their life.Sometimes you need a little push to go on. You make memories, you reminisce about the past, think about how life has changed and how you changed. Falling in love, getting to know that person which at first might seem difficult. Big hurtful words you say without thinking. All the hardships and joyful moments of your life.  But you need to remember even if everything falls down you can start painting your world with colors again. It's all there, represented through simple yet beautiful art. Puzzles (this part completely got me), coloring, walking, it's beautiful. I don't know what it is, but this game has something which triggers emotions and makes you think, maybe go to your partner and hug him/her, tell your mother you love her.Graphically it's very minimalistic but beautifully drawn. Not a lot to talk about graphics.No ultrawide for obvious reasons. Performance? No need to talk about it, if your PC can show pictures it will run this game.Music is really nice and it reflects the emotions your going through but I wish there would be a better transition when music changes.Get this if you appreciate art and interactive stories. The game is great but it's very short, sure it's only 5€ but i'd still suggest waiting for a sale.

The game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it.  What's inside? Story is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling.

People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.It paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that "routine" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.I liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters.

Bō / Toni	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055802307/	- Act I - Crush What to do on your sad Valentine's day, when you've canceled your own pity party and felt betrayed by your own feelings? Simple. To play the mobile game you've been hearing some good stuff about, which has been given a surprising Steam release. That's how I was introduced to Florence, anyway. I will skip that part of the game winning every possible award and beating all the best mobile games back when it was originally released. You most likely know that already. Besides, it's not that important. The feelings and experience are all that matters. As Maya Angelou famously said: I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. The same is fair for video games - you may forget many details about them, but you will always remember how some of them made you feel. And Florence? Quality emotions delivery service at the click of your mouse!  - Act II - Happy TogetherA wholesome and elegant mix of webcomic, puzzle game, and walking simulator elements will tell you a simple, ordinary even, story about day-to-day routine, escapism, dreams, first love, pain, inspiration, frustration, forgiveness. The story, relevant to many yet somewhat uniquely special for you. It's almost a self-help 'narrative' for your struggling adult life - although, I might have watched too many motivational youtube videos, so let's move on.Gameplay difficulty is at zero level, however, it's still quite enjoyable going through mini-games and being a part of interactive storytelling. Controls are quite simple, but I would recommend using your mouse, as it's more convenient (you will see why), but there's full controller support, if you prefer. Florence is unquestionably linear, but the illusion of choice and different interpretations of your own experience may give you something to ponder about at the end. I say: play it twice. The first time, when you are sad; the second time when you are happy. Test your emotions. Embrace the routine. Improve your St Valentine's Day.- Act III - RoutineOnce you beat the game, you'll have access to all the chapters separately, which is useful, if you want to go through all the achievements. It took me about an hour to complete 30 mins game which felt like a brief moment. I wanted more and I played it again. You know it's good when the time feels faster than it actually is. There are also rumors you can speedrun this game for ~15 mins, but I'm not even sure why I'm telling you this? Music also plays a significant role - it's quite lighthearted, but so on point and will dictate the swings of your mood. The original soundtrack is included, so you can listen to it anytime.- Act IV - The EndIn short: it's when simplicity beats everything. It is a simple yet beautiful experience, and after that short period of time with Florence you may forget the details, but you will remember how this game made you feel. Give it a try. Special thank you to the wonderful Samurai Punk team, who have ported this game to both PC & Switch and made this experience possible!  PS: Thank you all for reading - appreciate your time!

kgsizemo	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198202715070/	My girl does not like crust! ---- SPOILERS!!!! ---- First, let me say that the score for this game is phenomenal! O.k., now that I've addressed that aspect, I will continue with my take on the game's plot.This plot reminds me of one of my favorite movies, La La Land. Although they are technically love stories, both Florence and La La Land have this seemingly tragic element to them. The relationships do not last. This does not mean that the time spent in said relationships were wasted.In Florence's case, both characters were stuck in ruts before they met, just going through the day-to-day motions. Once they met, and eventually began dating, they started to open up and share their thoughts. Their passions. Because they both developed care and affection for each other, they each pushed one another to pursue said passions. If not for Florence, Krish would not have applied for the music academy; If not for Krish, Florence might not have chased her dream of becoming an artist.Both Florence and Krish set one another on a better path than they were on.While Florence and Krish did not end up together, both hugely impacted one another. This is not a sad story. Sometimes people come into your life only for a season... and it can be a beautiful season! Just because the relationship did not last, that does not mean the memories, lessons, or admiration for the other person has to end as well.This game is good. Check it out.

Bodomi	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bodomi/	Florence is an overpriced 30-minute short novel with an un-relatable, and in my opinion horrible story and extremely monotonous 'puzzles'/mini-games that feels like homework for a young child, matching geometrical shapes together and solving math problems like 8+?=16.What I grasp from the moral of story is that: moms are annoying, digital things are bad, anything but homemade cultural meals are negative, a stable relationship with routine is bad, and a good career change in your mid-20's is to start doing something you did as a toddler and never again after that.The art and music is really good but I don't give games positive reviews because they had a wonderful art-style and good soundtrack, unlike most of the people who have given this game a positive review.In the end it sucked. It was boring, the moral of the story was horrible and the last half of the game was just a bunch of fanciful nonsense that would never happen in reality.It's a banal and dull love story. It tries to be deep, but it really isn't.If the game was longer with a lot more detail on how the 2 main characters relationship developed and way more detail on how she continued her sudden artist career it could maybe be a mediocre thing and not a waste of money, but not this 30-minute crap story with a very sudden ending of her deciding to pursue an art career because she drew as a child, like 99% of all children in her shoes did.Curator pageIf you liked this review or otherwise found it helpful in deciding whether or not to buy this game, feel free to follow my Curator page.Edit: All of a sudden my Steam Curator page link is being censored in this review, shows up just fine in all my other reviews.Edit edit: And it's back, after several hours.Edit edit edit: And a few days ago the review was completely removed from the store page.

O.k., now that I've addressed that aspect, I will continue with my take on the game's plot.This plot reminds me of one of my favorite movies, La La Land. Although they are technically love stories, both Florence and La La Land have this seemingly tragic element to them. The relationships do not last. This does not mean that the time spent in said relationships were wasted.In Florence's case, both characters were stuck in ruts before they met, just going through the day-to-day motions. Once they met, and eventually began dating, they started to open up and share their thoughts. Their passions. Because they both developed care and affection for each other, they each pushed one another to pursue said passions. If not for Florence, Krish would not have applied for the music academy; If not for Krish, Florence might not have chased her dream of becoming an artist.Both Florence and Krish set one another on a better path than they were on.While Florence and Krish did not end up together, both hugely impacted one another. This is not a sad story. Sometimes people come into your life only for a season... and it can be a beautiful season!

Bodomi	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bodomi/	Florence is an overpriced 30-minute short novel with an un-relatable, and in my opinion horrible story and extremely monotonous 'puzzles'/mini-games that feels like homework for a young child, matching geometrical shapes together and solving math problems like 8+?=16.What I grasp from the moral of story is that: moms are annoying, digital things are bad, anything but homemade cultural meals are negative, a stable relationship with routine is bad, and a good career change in your mid-20's is to start doing something you did as a toddler and never again after that.The art and music is really good but I don't give games positive reviews because they had a wonderful art-style and good soundtrack, unlike most of the people who have given this game a positive review.In the end it sucked. It was boring, the moral of the story was horrible and the last half of the game was just a bunch of fanciful nonsense that would never happen in reality.It's a banal and dull love story. It tries to be deep, but it really isn't.If the game was longer with a lot more detail on how the 2 main characters relationship developed and way more detail on how she continued her sudden artist career it could maybe be a mediocre thing and not a waste of money, but not this 30-minute crap story with a very sudden ending of her deciding to pursue an art career because she drew as a child, like 99% of all children in her shoes did.Curator pageIf you liked this review or otherwise found it helpful in deciding whether or not to buy this game, feel free to follow my Curator page.Edit: All of a sudden my Steam Curator page link is being censored in this review, shows up just fine in all my other reviews.Edit edit: And it's back, after several hours.Edit edit edit: And a few days ago the review was completely removed from the store page.

Kosmozuikis	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kosmozuikis/	Sometimes simplicity is all you need, no words, no fancy graphics, just beautiful art to deliver a powerful messageFlorence is a very short interactive story of a girl and some stages of her life. It's simple, lasts only for about and hour but has a huge impact on you.The idea along with the artstyle is really neat. The whole gameplay is just scrolling through images sometimes doing simple tasks. But those tasks usually have a deeper meaning. There are some moving scenes, again with a meaning.It's a very heartwarming and maybe a little heartbreaking story but so is life. A lot of people will see themselves in this game, same stuff many people go through in their life.Sometimes you need a little push to go on. You make memories, you reminisce about the past, think about how life has changed and how you changed. Falling in love, getting to know that person which at first might seem difficult. Big hurtful words you say without thinking. All the hardships and joyful moments of your life.  But you need to remember even if everything falls down you can start painting your world with colors again. It's all there, represented through simple yet beautiful art. Puzzles (this part completely got me), coloring, walking, it's beautiful. I don't know what it is, but this game has something which triggers emotions and makes you think, maybe go to your partner and hug him/her, tell your mother you love her.Graphically it's very minimalistic but beautifully drawn. Not a lot to talk about graphics.No ultrawide for obvious reasons. Performance? No need to talk about it, if your PC can show pictures it will run this game.Music is really nice and it reflects the emotions your going through but I wish there would be a better transition when music changes.Get this if you appreciate art and interactive stories. The game is great but it's very short, sure it's only 5€ but i'd still suggest waiting for a sale.

EliteSpartanKiller906	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198346841484/	 Too much for too little? The game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it.  What's inside? Story is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling.  Conclusion I highly recommend this game for anyone with feeeels and without. It's short, but as they say it "packs a punch".

i_Go_SpLaT	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/i_Go_SpLaT/	Started strong, ended annoyingly.Moral of the story? People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.It paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that "routine" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.I liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.At least it was short. 
Bō / Toni	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055802307/	- Act I - Crush What to do on your sad Valentine's day, when you've canceled your own pity party and felt betrayed by your own feelings? Simple. To play the mobile game you've been hearing some good stuff about, which has been given a surprising Steam release. That's how I was introduced to Florence, anyway. I will skip that part of the game winning every possible award and beating all the best mobile games back when it was originally released. You most likely know that already. Besides, it's not that important. The feelings and experience are all that matters. As Maya Angelou famously said: I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. The same is fair for video games - you may forget many details about them, but you will always remember how some of them made you feel. And Florence? Quality emotions delivery service at the click of your mouse!  - Act II - Happy TogetherA wholesome and elegant mix of webcomic, puzzle game, and walking simulator elements will tell you a simple, ordinary even, story about day-to-day routine, escapism, dreams, first love, pain, inspiration, frustration, forgiveness. The story, relevant to many yet somewhat uniquely special for you. It's almost a self-help 'narrative' for your struggling adult life - although, I might have watched too many motivational youtube videos, so let's move on.Gameplay difficulty is at zero level, however, it's still quite enjoyable going through mini-games and being a part of interactive storytelling. Controls are quite simple, but I would recommend using your mouse, as it's more convenient (you will see why), but there's full controller support, if you prefer. Florence is unquestionably linear, but the illusion of choice and different interpretations of your own experience may give you something to ponder about at the end. I say: play it twice. The first time, when you are sad; the second time when you are happy. Test your emotions. Embrace the routine. Improve your St Valentine's Day.- Act III - RoutineOnce you beat the game, you'll have access to all the chapters separately, which is useful, if you want to go through all the achievements. It took me about an hour to complete 30 mins game which felt like a brief moment. I wanted more and I played it again. You know it's good when the time feels faster than it actually is. There are also rumors you can speedrun this game for ~15 mins, but I'm not even sure why I'm telling you this? Music also plays a significant role - it's quite lighthearted, but so on point and will dictate the swings of your mood. The original soundtrack is included, so you can listen to it anytime.- Act IV - The EndIn short: it's when simplicity beats everything. It is a simple yet beautiful experience, and after that short period of time with Florence you may forget the details, but you will remember how this game made you feel. Give it a try. Special thank you to the wonderful Samurai Punk team, who have ported this game to both PC & Switch and made this experience possible!  PS: Thank you all for reading - appreciate your time!

People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.It paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that "routine" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.I liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.At least it was short. 
Bō / Toni	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055802307/	- Act I - Crush What to do on your sad Valentine's day, when you've canceled your own pity party and felt betrayed by your own feelings? Simple. To play the mobile game you've been hearing some good stuff about, which has been given a surprising Steam release. That's how I was introduced to Florence, anyway. I will skip that part of the game winning every possible award and beating all the best mobile games back when it was originally released. You most likely know that already. Besides, it's not that important. The feelings and experience are all that matters. As Maya Angelou famously said: I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. The same is fair for video games - you may forget many details about them, but you will always remember how some of them made you feel. And Florence? Quality emotions delivery service at the click of your mouse!  - Act II - Happy TogetherA wholesome and elegant mix of webcomic, puzzle game, and walking simulator elements will tell you a simple, ordinary even, story about day-to-day routine, escapism, dreams, first love, pain, inspiration, frustration, forgiveness. The story, relevant to many yet somewhat uniquely special for you. It's almost a self-help 'narrative' for your struggling adult life - although, I might have watched too many motivational youtube videos, so let's move on.Gameplay difficulty is at zero level, however, it's still quite enjoyable going through mini-games and being a part of interactive storytelling. Controls are quite simple, but I would recommend using your mouse, as it's more convenient (you will see why), but there's full controller support, if you prefer. Florence is unquestionably linear, but the illusion of choice and different interpretations of your own experience may give you something to ponder about at the end. I say: play it twice. The first time, when you are sad; the second time when you are happy. Test your emotions. Embrace the routine. Improve your St Valentine's Day.- Act III - RoutineOnce you beat the game, you'll have access to all the chapters separately, which is useful, if you want to go through all the achievements. It took me about an hour to complete 30 mins game which felt like a brief moment. I wanted more and I played it again. You know it's good when the time feels faster than it actually is. There are also rumors you can speedrun this game for ~15 mins, but I'm not even sure why I'm telling you this? Music also plays a significant role - it's quite lighthearted, but so on point and will dictate the swings of your mood. The original soundtrack is included, so you can listen to it anytime.- Act IV - The EndIn short: it's when simplicity beats everything. It is a simple yet beautiful experience, and after that short period of time with Florence you may forget the details, but you will remember how this game made you feel. Give it a try. Special thank you to the wonderful Samurai Punk team, who have ported this game to both PC & Switch and made this experience possible!  PS: Thank you all for reading - appreciate your time! Much love ~

O.k., now that I've addressed that aspect, I will continue with my take on the game's plot.This plot reminds me of one of my favorite movies, La La Land. Although they are technically love stories, both Florence and La La Land have this seemingly tragic element to them. The relationships do not last. This does not mean that the time spent in said relationships were wasted.In Florence's case, both characters were stuck in ruts before they met, just going through the day-to-day motions. Once they met, and eventually began dating, they started to open up and share their thoughts. Their passions. Because they both developed care and affection for each other, they each pushed one another to pursue said passions. If not for Florence, Krish would not have applied for the music academy; If not for Krish, Florence might not have chased her dream of becoming an artist.Both Florence and Krish set one another on a better path than they were on.While Florence and Krish did not end up together, both hugely impacted one another. This is not a sad story. Sometimes people come into your life only for a season... and it can be a beautiful season! Just because the relationship did not last, that does not mean the memories, lessons, or admiration for the other person has to end as well.This game is good. Check it out.

Bodomi	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bodomi/	Florence is an overpriced 30-minute short novel with an un-relatable, and in my opinion horrible story and extremely monotonous 'puzzles'/mini-games that feels like homework for a young child, matching geometrical shapes together and solving math problems like 8+?=16.What I grasp from the moral of story is that: moms are annoying, digital things are bad, anything but homemade cultural meals are negative, a stable relationship with routine is bad, and a good career change in your mid-20's is to start doing something you did as a toddler and never again after that.The art and music is really good but I don't give games positive reviews because they had a wonderful art-style and good soundtrack, unlike most of the people who have given this game a positive review.In the end it sucked. It was boring, the moral of the story was horrible and the last half of the game was just a bunch of fanciful nonsense that would never happen in reality.It's a banal and dull love story. It tries to be deep, but it really isn't.If the game was longer with a lot more detail on how the 2 main characters relationship developed and way more detail on how she continued her sudden artist career it could maybe be a mediocre thing and not a waste of money, but not this 30-minute crap story with a very sudden ending of her deciding to pursue an art career because she drew as a child, like 99% of all children in her shoes did.Curator pageIf you liked this review or otherwise found it helpful in deciding whether or not to buy this game, feel free to follow my Curator page.Edit: All of a sudden my Steam Curator page link is being censored in this review, shows up just fine in all my other reviews.Edit edit: And it's back, after several hours.Edit edit edit: And a few days ago the review was completely removed from the store page.

Pros- +Great looking art style with visual storytelling that I never really expected. There were so many moments where I sat for a second like, hey that's actually really smart, mainly in regards to having conversations and such +Beautiful OST +Coming of age/relationship based story that I'm sure 99% of people can relate to. The story and pacing is really good, despite there being few words explicitly spoken through the whole gameCons--The game is rather short, which in an of itself isn't a big issue, I just wish we got to experience more of this story! It's difficult to say anything bad about this game, it's a short story-rich experience that can get you feeling all sorts of emotions. If that's your thing, you'll probably dig it!  Rating: 3.5/5 
Kosmozuikis	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kosmozuikis/	Sometimes simplicity is all you need, no words, no fancy graphics, just beautiful art to deliver a powerful messageFlorence is a very short interactive story of a girl and some stages of her life. It's simple, lasts only for about and hour but has a huge impact on you.The idea along with the artstyle is really neat. The whole gameplay is just scrolling through images sometimes doing simple tasks. But those tasks usually have a deeper meaning. There are some moving scenes, again with a meaning.It's a very heartwarming and maybe a little heartbreaking story but so is life. A lot of people will see themselves in this game, same stuff many people go through in their life.Sometimes you need a little push to go on. You make memories, you reminisce about the past, think about how life has changed and how you changed. Falling in love, getting to know that person which at first might seem difficult. Big hurtful words you say without thinking. All the hardships and joyful moments of your life.  But you need to remember even if everything falls down you can start painting your world with colors again. It's all there, represented through simple yet beautiful art. Puzzles (this part completely got me), coloring, walking, it's beautiful. I don't know what it is, but this game has something which triggers emotions and makes you think, maybe go to your partner and hug him/her, tell your mother you love her.Graphically it's very minimalistic but beautifully drawn. Not a lot to talk about graphics.No ultrawide for obvious reasons. Performance? No need to talk about it, if your PC can show pictures it will run this game.Music is really nice and it reflects the emotions your going through but I wish there would be a better transition when music changes.Get this if you appreciate art and interactive stories. The game is great but it's very short, sure it's only 5€ but i'd still suggest waiting for a sale. But hey at least it's not 20€ like Gone Home (loved it too btw, but the price...).ProsBeautiful artGood musicYour life on a plateConsCould be a little longerFollow my curator page for more 
EliteSpartanKiller906	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198346841484/	 Too much for too little? The game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it.  What's inside? Story is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling.  Conclusion I highly recommend this game for anyone with feeeels and without. It's short, but as they say it "packs a punch".

Kosmozuikis	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kosmozuikis/	Sometimes simplicity is all you need, no words, no fancy graphics, just beautiful art to deliver a powerful messageFlorence is a very short interactive story of a girl and some stages of her life. It's simple, lasts only for about and hour but has a huge impact on you.The idea along with the artstyle is really neat. The whole gameplay is just scrolling through images sometimes doing simple tasks. But those tasks usually have a deeper meaning. There are some moving scenes, again with a meaning.It's a very heartwarming and maybe a little heartbreaking story but so is life. A lot of people will see themselves in this game, same stuff many people go through in their life.Sometimes you need a little push to go on. You make memories, you reminisce about the past, think about how life has changed and how you changed. Falling in love, getting to know that person which at first might seem difficult. Big hurtful words you say without thinking. All the hardships and joyful moments of your life.  But you need to remember even if everything falls down you can start painting your world with colors again. It's all there, represented through simple yet beautiful art. Puzzles (this part completely got me), coloring, walking, it's beautiful. I don't know what it is, but this game has something which triggers emotions and makes you think, maybe go to your partner and hug him/her, tell your mother you love her.Graphically it's very minimalistic but beautifully drawn. Not a lot to talk about graphics.No ultrawide for obvious reasons. Performance? No need to talk about it, if your PC can show pictures it will run this game.Music is really nice and it reflects the emotions your going through but I wish there would be a better transition when music changes.Get this if you appreciate art and interactive stories. The game is great but it's very short, sure it's only 5€ but i'd still suggest waiting for a sale.

The game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it.  What's inside? Story is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling.

People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.It paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that "routine" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.I liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters.

Bō / Toni	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055802307/	- Act I - Crush What to do on your sad Valentine's day, when you've canceled your own pity party and felt betrayed by your own feelings? Simple. To play the mobile game you've been hearing some good stuff about, which has been given a surprising Steam release. That's how I was introduced to Florence, anyway. I will skip that part of the game winning every possible award and beating all the best mobile games back when it was originally released. You most likely know that already. Besides, it's not that important. The feelings and experience are all that matters. As Maya Angelou famously said: I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. The same is fair for video games - you may forget many details about them, but you will always remember how some of them made you feel. And Florence? Quality emotions delivery service at the click of your mouse!  - Act II - Happy TogetherA wholesome and elegant mix of webcomic, puzzle game, and walking simulator elements will tell you a simple, ordinary even, story about day-to-day routine, escapism, dreams, first love, pain, inspiration, frustration, forgiveness. The story, relevant to many yet somewhat uniquely special for you. It's almost a self-help 'narrative' for your struggling adult life - although, I might have watched too many motivational youtube videos, so let's move on.Gameplay difficulty is at zero level, however, it's still quite enjoyable going through mini-games and being a part of interactive storytelling. Controls are quite simple, but I would recommend using your mouse, as it's more convenient (you will see why), but there's full controller support, if you prefer. Florence is unquestionably linear, but the illusion of choice and different interpretations of your own experience may give you something to ponder about at the end. I say: play it twice. The first time, when you are sad; the second time when you are happy. Test your emotions. Embrace the routine. Improve your St Valentine's Day.- Act III - RoutineOnce you beat the game, you'll have access to all the chapters separately, which is useful, if you want to go through all the achievements. It took me about an hour to complete 30 mins game which felt like a brief moment. I wanted more and I played it again. You know it's good when the time feels faster than it actually is. There are also rumors you can speedrun this game for ~15 mins, but I'm not even sure why I'm telling you this? Music also plays a significant role - it's quite lighthearted, but so on point and will dictate the swings of your mood. The original soundtrack is included, so you can listen to it anytime.- Act IV - The EndIn short: it's when simplicity beats everything. It is a simple yet beautiful experience, and after that short period of time with Florence you may forget the details, but you will remember how this game made you feel. Give it a try. Special thank you to the wonderful Samurai Punk team, who have ported this game to both PC & Switch and made this experience possible!  PS: Thank you all for reading - appreciate your time!

kgsizemo	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198202715070/	My girl does not like crust! ---- SPOILERS!!!! ---- First, let me say that the score for this game is phenomenal! O.k., now that I've addressed that aspect, I will continue with my take on the game's plot.This plot reminds me of one of my favorite movies, La La Land. Although they are technically love stories, both Florence and La La Land have this seemingly tragic element to them. The relationships do not last. This does not mean that the time spent in said relationships were wasted.In Florence's case, both characters were stuck in ruts before they met, just going through the day-to-day motions. Once they met, and eventually began dating, they started to open up and share their thoughts. Their passions. Because they both developed care and affection for each other, they each pushed one another to pursue said passions. If not for Florence, Krish would not have applied for the music academy; If not for Krish, Florence might not have chased her dream of becoming an artist.Both Florence and Krish set one another on a better path than they were on.While Florence and Krish did not end up together, both hugely impacted one another. This is not a sad story. Sometimes people come into your life only for a season... and it can be a beautiful season! Just because the relationship did not last, that does not mean the memories, lessons, or admiration for the other person has to end as well.This game is good. Check it out.

Bodomi	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bodomi/	Florence is an overpriced 30-minute short novel with an un-relatable, and in my opinion horrible story and extremely monotonous 'puzzles'/mini-games that feels like homework for a young child, matching geometrical shapes together and solving math problems like 8+?=16.What I grasp from the moral of story is that: moms are annoying, digital things are bad, anything but homemade cultural meals are negative, a stable relationship with routine is bad, and a good career change in your mid-20's is to start doing something you did as a toddler and never again after that.The art and music is really good but I don't give games positive reviews because they had a wonderful art-style and good soundtrack, unlike most of the people who have given this game a positive review.In the end it sucked. It was boring, the moral of the story was horrible and the last half of the game was just a bunch of fanciful nonsense that would never happen in reality.It's a banal and dull love story. It tries to be deep, but it really isn't.If the game was longer with a lot more detail on how the 2 main characters relationship developed and way more detail on how she continued her sudden artist career it could maybe be a mediocre thing and not a waste of money, but not this 30-minute crap story with a very sudden ending of her deciding to pursue an art career because she drew as a child, like 99% of all children in her shoes did.Curator pageIf you liked this review or otherwise found it helpful in deciding whether or not to buy this game, feel free to follow my Curator page.Edit: All of a sudden my Steam Curator page link is being censored in this review, shows up just fine in all my other reviews.Edit edit: And it's back, after several hours.Edit edit edit: And a few days ago the review was completely removed from the store page.

O.k., now that I've addressed that aspect, I will continue with my take on the game's plot.This plot reminds me of one of my favorite movies, La La Land. Although they are technically love stories, both Florence and La La Land have this seemingly tragic element to them. The relationships do not last. This does not mean that the time spent in said relationships were wasted.In Florence's case, both characters were stuck in ruts before they met, just going through the day-to-day motions. Once they met, and eventually began dating, they started to open up and share their thoughts. Their passions. Because they both developed care and affection for each other, they each pushed one another to pursue said passions. If not for Florence, Krish would not have applied for the music academy; If not for Krish, Florence might not have chased her dream of becoming an artist.Both Florence and Krish set one another on a better path than they were on.While Florence and Krish did not end up together, both hugely impacted one another. This is not a sad story. Sometimes people come into your life only for a season... and it can be a beautiful season!

Bodomi	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bodomi/	Florence is an overpriced 30-minute short novel with an un-relatable, and in my opinion horrible story and extremely monotonous 'puzzles'/mini-games that feels like homework for a young child, matching geometrical shapes together and solving math problems like 8+?=16.What I grasp from the moral of story is that: moms are annoying, digital things are bad, anything but homemade cultural meals are negative, a stable relationship with routine is bad, and a good career change in your mid-20's is to start doing something you did as a toddler and never again after that.The art and music is really good but I don't give games positive reviews because they had a wonderful art-style and good soundtrack, unlike most of the people who have given this game a positive review.In the end it sucked. It was boring, the moral of the story was horrible and the last half of the game was just a bunch of fanciful nonsense that would never happen in reality.It's a banal and dull love story. It tries to be deep, but it really isn't.If the game was longer with a lot more detail on how the 2 main characters relationship developed and way more detail on how she continued her sudden artist career it could maybe be a mediocre thing and not a waste of money, but not this 30-minute crap story with a very sudden ending of her deciding to pursue an art career because she drew as a child, like 99% of all children in her shoes did.Curator pageIf you liked this review or otherwise found it helpful in deciding whether or not to buy this game, feel free to follow my Curator page.Edit: All of a sudden my Steam Curator page link is being censored in this review, shows up just fine in all my other reviews.Edit edit: And it's back, after several hours.Edit edit edit: And a few days ago the review was completely removed from the store page.

Kosmozuikis	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kosmozuikis/	Sometimes simplicity is all you need, no words, no fancy graphics, just beautiful art to deliver a powerful messageFlorence is a very short interactive story of a girl and some stages of her life. It's simple, lasts only for about and hour but has a huge impact on you.The idea along with the artstyle is really neat. The whole gameplay is just scrolling through images sometimes doing simple tasks. But those tasks usually have a deeper meaning. There are some moving scenes, again with a meaning.It's a very heartwarming and maybe a little heartbreaking story but so is life. A lot of people will see themselves in this game, same stuff many people go through in their life.Sometimes you need a little push to go on. You make memories, you reminisce about the past, think about how life has changed and how you changed. Falling in love, getting to know that person which at first might seem difficult. Big hurtful words you say without thinking. All the hardships and joyful moments of your life.  But you need to remember even if everything falls down you can start painting your world with colors again. It's all there, represented through simple yet beautiful art. Puzzles (this part completely got me), coloring, walking, it's beautiful. I don't know what it is, but this game has something which triggers emotions and makes you think, maybe go to your partner and hug him/her, tell your mother you love her.Graphically it's very minimalistic but beautifully drawn. Not a lot to talk about graphics.No ultrawide for obvious reasons. Performance? No need to talk about it, if your PC can show pictures it will run this game.Music is really nice and it reflects the emotions your going through but I wish there would be a better transition when music changes.Get this if you appreciate art and interactive stories. The game is great but it's very short, sure it's only 5€ but i'd still suggest waiting for a sale.

EliteSpartanKiller906	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198346841484/	 Too much for too little? The game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it.  What's inside? Story is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling.  Conclusion I highly recommend this game for anyone with feeeels and without. It's short, but as they say it "packs a punch".

i_Go_SpLaT	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/i_Go_SpLaT/	Started strong, ended annoyingly.Moral of the story? People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.It paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that "routine" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.I liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.At least it was short. 
Bō / Toni	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055802307/	- Act I - Crush What to do on your sad Valentine's day, when you've canceled your own pity party and felt betrayed by your own feelings? Simple. To play the mobile game you've been hearing some good stuff about, which has been given a surprising Steam release. That's how I was introduced to Florence, anyway. I will skip that part of the game winning every possible award and beating all the best mobile games back when it was originally released. You most likely know that already. Besides, it's not that important. The feelings and experience are all that matters. As Maya Angelou famously said: I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. The same is fair for video games - you may forget many details about them, but you will always remember how some of them made you feel. And Florence? Quality emotions delivery service at the click of your mouse!  - Act II - Happy TogetherA wholesome and elegant mix of webcomic, puzzle game, and walking simulator elements will tell you a simple, ordinary even, story about day-to-day routine, escapism, dreams, first love, pain, inspiration, frustration, forgiveness. The story, relevant to many yet somewhat uniquely special for you. It's almost a self-help 'narrative' for your struggling adult life - although, I might have watched too many motivational youtube videos, so let's move on.Gameplay difficulty is at zero level, however, it's still quite enjoyable going through mini-games and being a part of interactive storytelling. Controls are quite simple, but I would recommend using your mouse, as it's more convenient (you will see why), but there's full controller support, if you prefer. Florence is unquestionably linear, but the illusion of choice and different interpretations of your own experience may give you something to ponder about at the end. I say: play it twice. The first time, when you are sad; the second time when you are happy. Test your emotions. Embrace the routine. Improve your St Valentine's Day.- Act III - RoutineOnce you beat the game, you'll have access to all the chapters separately, which is useful, if you want to go through all the achievements. It took me about an hour to complete 30 mins game which felt like a brief moment. I wanted more and I played it again. You know it's good when the time feels faster than it actually is. There are also rumors you can speedrun this game for ~15 mins, but I'm not even sure why I'm telling you this? Music also plays a significant role - it's quite lighthearted, but so on point and will dictate the swings of your mood. The original soundtrack is included, so you can listen to it anytime.- Act IV - The EndIn short: it's when simplicity beats everything. It is a simple yet beautiful experience, and after that short period of time with Florence you may forget the details, but you will remember how this game made you feel. Give it a try. Special thank you to the wonderful Samurai Punk team, who have ported this game to both PC & Switch and made this experience possible!  PS: Thank you all for reading - appreciate your time!

People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.It paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that "routine" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.I liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.At least it was short. 
Bō / Toni	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055802307/	- Act I - Crush What to do on your sad Valentine's day, when you've canceled your own pity party and felt betrayed by your own feelings? Simple. To play the mobile game you've been hearing some good stuff about, which has been given a surprising Steam release. That's how I was introduced to Florence, anyway. I will skip that part of the game winning every possible award and beating all the best mobile games back when it was originally released. You most likely know that already. Besides, it's not that important. The feelings and experience are all that matters. As Maya Angelou famously said: I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. The same is fair for video games - you may forget many details about them, but you will always remember how some of them made you feel. And Florence? Quality emotions delivery service at the click of your mouse!  - Act II - Happy TogetherA wholesome and elegant mix of webcomic, puzzle game, and walking simulator elements will tell you a simple, ordinary even, story about day-to-day routine, escapism, dreams, first love, pain, inspiration, frustration, forgiveness. The story, relevant to many yet somewhat uniquely special for you. It's almost a self-help 'narrative' for your struggling adult life - although, I might have watched too many motivational youtube videos, so let's move on.Gameplay difficulty is at zero level, however, it's still quite enjoyable going through mini-games and being a part of interactive storytelling. Controls are quite simple, but I would recommend using your mouse, as it's more convenient (you will see why), but there's full controller support, if you prefer. Florence is unquestionably linear, but the illusion of choice and different interpretations of your own experience may give you something to ponder about at the end. I say: play it twice. The first time, when you are sad; the second time when you are happy. Test your emotions. Embrace the routine. Improve your St Valentine's Day.- Act III - RoutineOnce you beat the game, you'll have access to all the chapters separately, which is useful, if you want to go through all the achievements. It took me about an hour to complete 30 mins game which felt like a brief moment. I wanted more and I played it again. You know it's good when the time feels faster than it actually is. There are also rumors you can speedrun this game for ~15 mins, but I'm not even sure why I'm telling you this? Music also plays a significant role - it's quite lighthearted, but so on point and will dictate the swings of your mood. The original soundtrack is included, so you can listen to it anytime.- Act IV - The EndIn short: it's when simplicity beats everything. It is a simple yet beautiful experience, and after that short period of time with Florence you may forget the details, but you will remember how this game made you feel. Give it a try. Special thank you to the wonderful Samurai Punk team, who have ported this game to both PC & Switch and made this experience possible!  PS: Thank you all for reading - appreciate your time! Much love ~

O.k., now that I've addressed that aspect, I will continue with my take on the game's plot.This plot reminds me of one of my favorite movies, La La Land. Although they are technically love stories, both Florence and La La Land have this seemingly tragic element to them. The relationships do not last. This does not mean that the time spent in said relationships were wasted.In Florence's case, both characters were stuck in ruts before they met, just going through the day-to-day motions. Once they met, and eventually began dating, they started to open up and share their thoughts. Their passions. Because they both developed care and affection for each other, they each pushed one another to pursue said passions. If not for Florence, Krish would not have applied for the music academy; If not for Krish, Florence might not have chased her dream of becoming an artist.Both Florence and Krish set one another on a better path than they were on.While Florence and Krish did not end up together, both hugely impacted one another. This is not a sad story. Sometimes people come into your life only for a season... and it can be a beautiful season! Just because the relationship did not last, that does not mean the memories, lessons, or admiration for the other person has to end as well.This game is good. Check it out.

Bodomi	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bodomi/	Florence is an overpriced 30-minute short novel with an un-relatable, and in my opinion horrible story and extremely monotonous 'puzzles'/mini-games that feels like homework for a young child, matching geometrical shapes together and solving math problems like 8+?=16.What I grasp from the moral of story is that: moms are annoying, digital things are bad, anything but homemade cultural meals are negative, a stable relationship with routine is bad, and a good career change in your mid-20's is to start doing something you did as a toddler and never again after that.The art and music is really good but I don't give games positive reviews because they had a wonderful art-style and good soundtrack, unlike most of the people who have given this game a positive review.In the end it sucked. It was boring, the moral of the story was horrible and the last half of the game was just a bunch of fanciful nonsense that would never happen in reality.It's a banal and dull love story. It tries to be deep, but it really isn't.If the game was longer with a lot more detail on how the 2 main characters relationship developed and way more detail on how she continued her sudden artist career it could maybe be a mediocre thing and not a waste of money, but not this 30-minute crap story with a very sudden ending of her deciding to pursue an art career because she drew as a child, like 99% of all children in her shoes did.Curator pageIf you liked this review or otherwise found it helpful in deciding whether or not to buy this game, feel free to follow my Curator page.Edit: All of a sudden my Steam Curator page link is being censored in this review, shows up just fine in all my other reviews.Edit edit: And it's back, after several hours.Edit edit edit: And a few days ago the review was completely removed from the store page.

Pros- +Great looking art style with visual storytelling that I never really expected. There were so many moments where I sat for a second like, hey that's actually really smart, mainly in regards to having conversations and such +Beautiful OST +Coming of age/relationship based story that I'm sure 99% of people can relate to. The story and pacing is really good, despite there being few words explicitly spoken through the whole gameCons--The game is rather short, which in an of itself isn't a big issue, I just wish we got to experience more of this story! It's difficult to say anything bad about this game, it's a short story-rich experience that can get you feeling all sorts of emotions. If that's your thing, you'll probably dig it!  Rating: 3.5/5 
Kosmozuikis	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kosmozuikis/	Sometimes simplicity is all you need, no words, no fancy graphics, just beautiful art to deliver a powerful messageFlorence is a very short interactive story of a girl and some stages of her life. It's simple, lasts only for about and hour but has a huge impact on you.The idea along with the artstyle is really neat. The whole gameplay is just scrolling through images sometimes doing simple tasks. But those tasks usually have a deeper meaning. There are some moving scenes, again with a meaning.It's a very heartwarming and maybe a little heartbreaking story but so is life. A lot of people will see themselves in this game, same stuff many people go through in their life.Sometimes you need a little push to go on. You make memories, you reminisce about the past, think about how life has changed and how you changed. Falling in love, getting to know that person which at first might seem difficult. Big hurtful words you say without thinking. All the hardships and joyful moments of your life.  But you need to remember even if everything falls down you can start painting your world with colors again. It's all there, represented through simple yet beautiful art. Puzzles (this part completely got me), coloring, walking, it's beautiful. I don't know what it is, but this game has something which triggers emotions and makes you think, maybe go to your partner and hug him/her, tell your mother you love her.Graphically it's very minimalistic but beautifully drawn. Not a lot to talk about graphics.No ultrawide for obvious reasons. Performance? No need to talk about it, if your PC can show pictures it will run this game.Music is really nice and it reflects the emotions your going through but I wish there would be a better transition when music changes.Get this if you appreciate art and interactive stories. The game is great but it's very short, sure it's only 5€ but i'd still suggest waiting for a sale. But hey at least it's not 20€ like Gone Home (loved it too btw, but the price...).ProsBeautiful artGood musicYour life on a plateConsCould be a little longerFollow my curator page for more 
EliteSpartanKiller906	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198346841484/	 Too much for too little? The game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it.  What's inside? Story is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling.  Conclusion I highly recommend this game for anyone with feeeels and without. It's short, but as they say it "packs a punch".

Kosmozuikis	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kosmozuikis/	Sometimes simplicity is all you need, no words, no fancy graphics, just beautiful art to deliver a powerful messageFlorence is a very short interactive story of a girl and some stages of her life. It's simple, lasts only for about and hour but has a huge impact on you.The idea along with the artstyle is really neat. The whole gameplay is just scrolling through images sometimes doing simple tasks. But those tasks usually have a deeper meaning. There are some moving scenes, again with a meaning.It's a very heartwarming and maybe a little heartbreaking story but so is life. A lot of people will see themselves in this game, same stuff many people go through in their life.Sometimes you need a little push to go on. You make memories, you reminisce about the past, think about how life has changed and how you changed. Falling in love, getting to know that person which at first might seem difficult. Big hurtful words you say without thinking. All the hardships and joyful moments of your life.  But you need to remember even if everything falls down you can start painting your world with colors again. It's all there, represented through simple yet beautiful art. Puzzles (this part completely got me), coloring, walking, it's beautiful. I don't know what it is, but this game has something which triggers emotions and makes you think, maybe go to your partner and hug him/her, tell your mother you love her.Graphically it's very minimalistic but beautifully drawn. Not a lot to talk about graphics.No ultrawide for obvious reasons. Performance? No need to talk about it, if your PC can show pictures it will run this game.Music is really nice and it reflects the emotions your going through but I wish there would be a better transition when music changes.Get this if you appreciate art and interactive stories. The game is great but it's very short, sure it's only 5€ but i'd still suggest waiting for a sale.

The game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it.  What's inside? Story is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling.

People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.It paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that "routine" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.I liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters.

Bō / Toni	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055802307/	- Act I - Crush What to do on your sad Valentine's day, when you've canceled your own pity party and felt betrayed by your own feelings? Simple. To play the mobile game you've been hearing some good stuff about, which has been given a surprising Steam release. That's how I was introduced to Florence, anyway. I will skip that part of the game winning every possible award and beating all the best mobile games back when it was originally released. You most likely know that already. Besides, it's not that important. The feelings and experience are all that matters. As Maya Angelou famously said: I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. The same is fair for video games - you may forget many details about them, but you will always remember how some of them made you feel. And Florence? Quality emotions delivery service at the click of your mouse!  - Act II - Happy TogetherA wholesome and elegant mix of webcomic, puzzle game, and walking simulator elements will tell you a simple, ordinary even, story about day-to-day routine, escapism, dreams, first love, pain, inspiration, frustration, forgiveness. The story, relevant to many yet somewhat uniquely special for you. It's almost a self-help 'narrative' for your struggling adult life - although, I might have watched too many motivational youtube videos, so let's move on.Gameplay difficulty is at zero level, however, it's still quite enjoyable going through mini-games and being a part of interactive storytelling. Controls are quite simple, but I would recommend using your mouse, as it's more convenient (you will see why), but there's full controller support, if you prefer. Florence is unquestionably linear, but the illusion of choice and different interpretations of your own experience may give you something to ponder about at the end. I say: play it twice. The first time, when you are sad; the second time when you are happy. Test your emotions. Embrace the routine. Improve your St Valentine's Day.- Act III - RoutineOnce you beat the game, you'll have access to all the chapters separately, which is useful, if you want to go through all the achievements. It took me about an hour to complete 30 mins game which felt like a brief moment. I wanted more and I played it again. You know it's good when the time feels faster than it actually is. There are also rumors you can speedrun this game for ~15 mins, but I'm not even sure why I'm telling you this? Music also plays a significant role - it's quite lighthearted, but so on point and will dictate the swings of your mood. The original soundtrack is included, so you can listen to it anytime.- Act IV - The EndIn short: it's when simplicity beats everything. It is a simple yet beautiful experience, and after that short period of time with Florence you may forget the details, but you will remember how this game made you feel. Give it a try. Special thank you to the wonderful Samurai Punk team, who have ported this game to both PC & Switch and made this experience possible!  PS: Thank you all for reading - appreciate your time!

kgsizemo	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198202715070/	My girl does not like crust! ---- SPOILERS!!!! ---- First, let me say that the score for this game is phenomenal! O.k., now that I've addressed that aspect, I will continue with my take on the game's plot.This plot reminds me of one of my favorite movies, La La Land. Although they are technically love stories, both Florence and La La Land have this seemingly tragic element to them. The relationships do not last. This does not mean that the time spent in said relationships were wasted.In Florence's case, both characters were stuck in ruts before they met, just going through the day-to-day motions. Once they met, and eventually began dating, they started to open up and share their thoughts. Their passions. Because they both developed care and affection for each other, they each pushed one another to pursue said passions. If not for Florence, Krish would not have applied for the music academy; If not for Krish, Florence might not have chased her dream of becoming an artist.Both Florence and Krish set one another on a better path than they were on.While Florence and Krish did not end up together, both hugely impacted one another. This is not a sad story. Sometimes people come into your life only for a season... and it can be a beautiful season! Just because the relationship did not last, that does not mean the memories, lessons, or admiration for the other person has to end as well.This game is good. Check it out.

Bodomi	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bodomi/	Florence is an overpriced 30-minute short novel with an un-relatable, and in my opinion horrible story and extremely monotonous 'puzzles'/mini-games that feels like homework for a young child, matching geometrical shapes together and solving math problems like 8+?=16.What I grasp from the moral of story is that: moms are annoying, digital things are bad, anything but homemade cultural meals are negative, a stable relationship with routine is bad, and a good career change in your mid-20's is to start doing something you did as a toddler and never again after that.The art and music is really good but I don't give games positive reviews because they had a wonderful art-style and good soundtrack, unlike most of the people who have given this game a positive review.In the end it sucked. It was boring, the moral of the story was horrible and the last half of the game was just a bunch of fanciful nonsense that would never happen in reality.It's a banal and dull love story. It tries to be deep, but it really isn't.If the game was longer with a lot more detail on how the 2 main characters relationship developed and way more detail on how she continued her sudden artist career it could maybe be a mediocre thing and not a waste of money, but not this 30-minute crap story with a very sudden ending of her deciding to pursue an art career because she drew as a child, like 99% of all children in her shoes did.Curator pageIf you liked this review or otherwise found it helpful in deciding whether or not to buy this game, feel free to follow my Curator page.Edit: All of a sudden my Steam Curator page link is being censored in this review, shows up just fine in all my other reviews.Edit edit: And it's back, after several hours.Edit edit edit: And a few days ago the review was completely removed from the store page.

O.k., now that I've addressed that aspect, I will continue with my take on the game's plot.This plot reminds me of one of my favorite movies, La La Land. Although they are technically love stories, both Florence and La La Land have this seemingly tragic element to them. The relationships do not last. This does not mean that the time spent in said relationships were wasted.In Florence's case, both characters were stuck in ruts before they met, just going through the day-to-day motions. Once they met, and eventually began dating, they started to open up and share their thoughts. Their passions. Because they both developed care and affection for each other, they each pushed one another to pursue said passions. If not for Florence, Krish would not have applied for the music academy; If not for Krish, Florence might not have chased her dream of becoming an artist.Both Florence and Krish set one another on a better path than they were on.While Florence and Krish did not end up together, both hugely impacted one another. This is not a sad story. Sometimes people come into your life only for a season... and it can be a beautiful season!

Bodomi	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bodomi/	Florence is an overpriced 30-minute short novel with an un-relatable, and in my opinion horrible story and extremely monotonous 'puzzles'/mini-games that feels like homework for a young child, matching geometrical shapes together and solving math problems like 8+?=16.What I grasp from the moral of story is that: moms are annoying, digital things are bad, anything but homemade cultural meals are negative, a stable relationship with routine is bad, and a good career change in your mid-20's is to start doing something you did as a toddler and never again after that.The art and music is really good but I don't give games positive reviews because they had a wonderful art-style and good soundtrack, unlike most of the people who have given this game a positive review.In the end it sucked. It was boring, the moral of the story was horrible and the last half of the game was just a bunch of fanciful nonsense that would never happen in reality.It's a banal and dull love story. It tries to be deep, but it really isn't.If the game was longer with a lot more detail on how the 2 main characters relationship developed and way more detail on how she continued her sudden artist career it could maybe be a mediocre thing and not a waste of money, but not this 30-minute crap story with a very sudden ending of her deciding to pursue an art career because she drew as a child, like 99% of all children in her shoes did.Curator pageIf you liked this review or otherwise found it helpful in deciding whether or not to buy this game, feel free to follow my Curator page.Edit: All of a sudden my Steam Curator page link is being censored in this review, shows up just fine in all my other reviews.Edit edit: And it's back, after several hours.Edit edit edit: And a few days ago the review was completely removed from the store page.

Kosmozuikis	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kosmozuikis/	Sometimes simplicity is all you need, no words, no fancy graphics, just beautiful art to deliver a powerful messageFlorence is a very short interactive story of a girl and some stages of her life. It's simple, lasts only for about and hour but has a huge impact on you.The idea along with the artstyle is really neat. The whole gameplay is just scrolling through images sometimes doing simple tasks. But those tasks usually have a deeper meaning. There are some moving scenes, again with a meaning.It's a very heartwarming and maybe a little heartbreaking story but so is life. A lot of people will see themselves in this game, same stuff many people go through in their life.Sometimes you need a little push to go on. You make memories, you reminisce about the past, think about how life has changed and how you changed. Falling in love, getting to know that person which at first might seem difficult. Big hurtful words you say without thinking. All the hardships and joyful moments of your life.  But you need to remember even if everything falls down you can start painting your world with colors again. It's all there, represented through simple yet beautiful art. Puzzles (this part completely got me), coloring, walking, it's beautiful. I don't know what it is, but this game has something which triggers emotions and makes you think, maybe go to your partner and hug him/her, tell your mother you love her.Graphically it's very minimalistic but beautifully drawn. Not a lot to talk about graphics.No ultrawide for obvious reasons. Performance? No need to talk about it, if your PC can show pictures it will run this game.Music is really nice and it reflects the emotions your going through but I wish there would be a better transition when music changes.Get this if you appreciate art and interactive stories. The game is great but it's very short, sure it's only 5€ but i'd still suggest waiting for a sale.

EliteSpartanKiller906	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198346841484/	 Too much for too little? The game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it.  What's inside? Story is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling.  Conclusion I highly recommend this game for anyone with feeeels and without. It's short, but as they say it "packs a punch".

i_Go_SpLaT	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/i_Go_SpLaT/	Started strong, ended annoyingly.Moral of the story? People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.It paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that "routine" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.I liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.At least it was short. 
Bō / Toni	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055802307/	- Act I - Crush What to do on your sad Valentine's day, when you've canceled your own pity party and felt betrayed by your own feelings? Simple. To play the mobile game you've been hearing some good stuff about, which has been given a surprising Steam release. That's how I was introduced to Florence, anyway. I will skip that part of the game winning every possible award and beating all the best mobile games back when it was originally released. You most likely know that already. Besides, it's not that important. The feelings and experience are all that matters. As Maya Angelou famously said: I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. The same is fair for video games - you may forget many details about them, but you will always remember how some of them made you feel. And Florence? Quality emotions delivery service at the click of your mouse!  - Act II - Happy TogetherA wholesome and elegant mix of webcomic, puzzle game, and walking simulator elements will tell you a simple, ordinary even, story about day-to-day routine, escapism, dreams, first love, pain, inspiration, frustration, forgiveness. The story, relevant to many yet somewhat uniquely special for you. It's almost a self-help 'narrative' for your struggling adult life - although, I might have watched too many motivational youtube videos, so let's move on.Gameplay difficulty is at zero level, however, it's still quite enjoyable going through mini-games and being a part of interactive storytelling. Controls are quite simple, but I would recommend using your mouse, as it's more convenient (you will see why), but there's full controller support, if you prefer. Florence is unquestionably linear, but the illusion of choice and different interpretations of your own experience may give you something to ponder about at the end. I say: play it twice. The first time, when you are sad; the second time when you are happy. Test your emotions. Embrace the routine. Improve your St Valentine's Day.- Act III - RoutineOnce you beat the game, you'll have access to all the chapters separately, which is useful, if you want to go through all the achievements. It took me about an hour to complete 30 mins game which felt like a brief moment. I wanted more and I played it again. You know it's good when the time feels faster than it actually is. There are also rumors you can speedrun this game for ~15 mins, but I'm not even sure why I'm telling you this? Music also plays a significant role - it's quite lighthearted, but so on point and will dictate the swings of your mood. The original soundtrack is included, so you can listen to it anytime.- Act IV - The EndIn short: it's when simplicity beats everything. It is a simple yet beautiful experience, and after that short period of time with Florence you may forget the details, but you will remember how this game made you feel. Give it a try. Special thank you to the wonderful Samurai Punk team, who have ported this game to both PC & Switch and made this experience possible!  PS: Thank you all for reading - appreciate your time!

People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.It paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that "routine" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.I liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.At least it was short. 
Bō / Toni	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055802307/	- Act I - Crush What to do on your sad Valentine's day, when you've canceled your own pity party and felt betrayed by your own feelings? Simple. To play the mobile game you've been hearing some good stuff about, which has been given a surprising Steam release. That's how I was introduced to Florence, anyway. I will skip that part of the game winning every possible award and beating all the best mobile games back when it was originally released. You most likely know that already. Besides, it's not that important. The feelings and experience are all that matters. As Maya Angelou famously said: I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. The same is fair for video games - you may forget many details about them, but you will always remember how some of them made you feel. And Florence? Quality emotions delivery service at the click of your mouse!  - Act II - Happy TogetherA wholesome and elegant mix of webcomic, puzzle game, and walking simulator elements will tell you a simple, ordinary even, story about day-to-day routine, escapism, dreams, first love, pain, inspiration, frustration, forgiveness. The story, relevant to many yet somewhat uniquely special for you. It's almost a self-help 'narrative' for your struggling adult life - although, I might have watched too many motivational youtube videos, so let's move on.Gameplay difficulty is at zero level, however, it's still quite enjoyable going through mini-games and being a part of interactive storytelling. Controls are quite simple, but I would recommend using your mouse, as it's more convenient (you will see why), but there's full controller support, if you prefer. Florence is unquestionably linear, but the illusion of choice and different interpretations of your own experience may give you something to ponder about at the end. I say: play it twice. The first time, when you are sad; the second time when you are happy. Test your emotions. Embrace the routine. Improve your St Valentine's Day.- Act III - RoutineOnce you beat the game, you'll have access to all the chapters separately, which is useful, if you want to go through all the achievements. It took me about an hour to complete 30 mins game which felt like a brief moment. I wanted more and I played it again. You know it's good when the time feels faster than it actually is. There are also rumors you can speedrun this game for ~15 mins, but I'm not even sure why I'm telling you this? Music also plays a significant role - it's quite lighthearted, but so on point and will dictate the swings of your mood. The original soundtrack is included, so you can listen to it anytime.- Act IV - The EndIn short: it's when simplicity beats everything. It is a simple yet beautiful experience, and after that short period of time with Florence you may forget the details, but you will remember how this game made you feel. Give it a try. Special thank you to the wonderful Samurai Punk team, who have ported this game to both PC & Switch and made this experience possible!  PS: Thank you all for reading - appreciate your time! Much love ~

O.k., now that I've addressed that aspect, I will continue with my take on the game's plot.This plot reminds me of one of my favorite movies, La La Land. Although they are technically love stories, both Florence and La La Land have this seemingly tragic element to them. The relationships do not last. This does not mean that the time spent in said relationships were wasted.In Florence's case, both characters were stuck in ruts before they met, just going through the day-to-day motions. Once they met, and eventually began dating, they started to open up and share their thoughts. Their passions. Because they both developed care and affection for each other, they each pushed one another to pursue said passions. If not for Florence, Krish would not have applied for the music academy; If not for Krish, Florence might not have chased her dream of becoming an artist.Both Florence and Krish set one another on a better path than they were on.While Florence and Krish did not end up together, both hugely impacted one another. This is not a sad story. Sometimes people come into your life only for a season... and it can be a beautiful season! Just because the relationship did not last, that does not mean the memories, lessons, or admiration for the other person has to end as well.This game is good. Check it out.

Bodomi	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bodomi/	Florence is an overpriced 30-minute short novel with an un-relatable, and in my opinion horrible story and extremely monotonous 'puzzles'/mini-games that feels like homework for a young child, matching geometrical shapes together and solving math problems like 8+?=16.What I grasp from the moral of story is that: moms are annoying, digital things are bad, anything but homemade cultural meals are negative, a stable relationship with routine is bad, and a good career change in your mid-20's is to start doing something you did as a toddler and never again after that.The art and music is really good but I don't give games positive reviews because they had a wonderful art-style and good soundtrack, unlike most of the people who have given this game a positive review.In the end it sucked. It was boring, the moral of the story was horrible and the last half of the game was just a bunch of fanciful nonsense that would never happen in reality.It's a banal and dull love story. It tries to be deep, but it really isn't.If the game was longer with a lot more detail on how the 2 main characters relationship developed and way more detail on how she continued her sudden artist career it could maybe be a mediocre thing and not a waste of money, but not this 30-minute crap story with a very sudden ending of her deciding to pursue an art career because she drew as a child, like 99% of all children in her shoes did.Curator pageIf you liked this review or otherwise found it helpful in deciding whether or not to buy this game, feel free to follow my Curator page.Edit: All of a sudden my Steam Curator page link is being censored in this review, shows up just fine in all my other reviews.Edit edit: And it's back, after several hours.Edit edit edit: And a few days ago the review was completely removed from the store page.

Pros- +Great looking art style with visual storytelling that I never really expected. There were so many moments where I sat for a second like, hey that's actually really smart, mainly in regards to having conversations and such +Beautiful OST +Coming of age/relationship based story that I'm sure 99% of people can relate to. The story and pacing is really good, despite there being few words explicitly spoken through the whole gameCons--The game is rather short, which in an of itself isn't a big issue, I just wish we got to experience more of this story! It's difficult to say anything bad about this game, it's a short story-rich experience that can get you feeling all sorts of emotions. If that's your thing, you'll probably dig it!  Rating: 3.5/5 
Kosmozuikis	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kosmozuikis/	Sometimes simplicity is all you need, no words, no fancy graphics, just beautiful art to deliver a powerful messageFlorence is a very short interactive story of a girl and some stages of her life. It's simple, lasts only for about and hour but has a huge impact on you.The idea along with the artstyle is really neat. The whole gameplay is just scrolling through images sometimes doing simple tasks. But those tasks usually have a deeper meaning. There are some moving scenes, again with a meaning.It's a very heartwarming and maybe a little heartbreaking story but so is life. A lot of people will see themselves in this game, same stuff many people go through in their life.Sometimes you need a little push to go on. You make memories, you reminisce about the past, think about how life has changed and how you changed. Falling in love, getting to know that person which at first might seem difficult. Big hurtful words you say without thinking. All the hardships and joyful moments of your life.  But you need to remember even if everything falls down you can start painting your world with colors again. It's all there, represented through simple yet beautiful art. Puzzles (this part completely got me), coloring, walking, it's beautiful. I don't know what it is, but this game has something which triggers emotions and makes you think, maybe go to your partner and hug him/her, tell your mother you love her.Graphically it's very minimalistic but beautifully drawn. Not a lot to talk about graphics.No ultrawide for obvious reasons. Performance? No need to talk about it, if your PC can show pictures it will run this game.Music is really nice and it reflects the emotions your going through but I wish there would be a better transition when music changes.Get this if you appreciate art and interactive stories. The game is great but it's very short, sure it's only 5€ but i'd still suggest waiting for a sale. But hey at least it's not 20€ like Gone Home (loved it too btw, but the price...).ProsBeautiful artGood musicYour life on a plateConsCould be a little longerFollow my curator page for more 
EliteSpartanKiller906	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198346841484/	 Too much for too little? The game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it.  What's inside? Story is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling.  Conclusion I highly recommend this game for anyone with feeeels and without. It's short, but as they say it "packs a punch".

Kosmozuikis	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kosmozuikis/	Sometimes simplicity is all you need, no words, no fancy graphics, just beautiful art to deliver a powerful messageFlorence is a very short interactive story of a girl and some stages of her life. It's simple, lasts only for about and hour but has a huge impact on you.The idea along with the artstyle is really neat. The whole gameplay is just scrolling through images sometimes doing simple tasks. But those tasks usually have a deeper meaning. There are some moving scenes, again with a meaning.It's a very heartwarming and maybe a little heartbreaking story but so is life. A lot of people will see themselves in this game, same stuff many people go through in their life.Sometimes you need a little push to go on. You make memories, you reminisce about the past, think about how life has changed and how you changed. Falling in love, getting to know that person which at first might seem difficult. Big hurtful words you say without thinking. All the hardships and joyful moments of your life.  But you need to remember even if everything falls down you can start painting your world with colors again. It's all there, represented through simple yet beautiful art. Puzzles (this part completely got me), coloring, walking, it's beautiful. I don't know what it is, but this game has something which triggers emotions and makes you think, maybe go to your partner and hug him/her, tell your mother you love her.Graphically it's very minimalistic but beautifully drawn. Not a lot to talk about graphics.No ultrawide for obvious reasons. Performance? No need to talk about it, if your PC can show pictures it will run this game.Music is really nice and it reflects the emotions your going through but I wish there would be a better transition when music changes.Get this if you appreciate art and interactive stories. The game is great but it's very short, sure it's only 5€ but i'd still suggest waiting for a sale.

The game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it.  What's inside? Story is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling.

People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.It paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that "routine" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.I liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters.

Bō / Toni	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055802307/	- Act I - Crush What to do on your sad Valentine's day, when you've canceled your own pity party and felt betrayed by your own feelings? Simple. To play the mobile game you've been hearing some good stuff about, which has been given a surprising Steam release. That's how I was introduced to Florence, anyway. I will skip that part of the game winning every possible award and beating all the best mobile games back when it was originally released. You most likely know that already. Besides, it's not that important. The feelings and experience are all that matters. As Maya Angelou famously said: I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. The same is fair for video games - you may forget many details about them, but you will always remember how some of them made you feel. And Florence? Quality emotions delivery service at the click of your mouse!  - Act II - Happy TogetherA wholesome and elegant mix of webcomic, puzzle game, and walking simulator elements will tell you a simple, ordinary even, story about day-to-day routine, escapism, dreams, first love, pain, inspiration, frustration, forgiveness. The story, relevant to many yet somewhat uniquely special for you. It's almost a self-help 'narrative' for your struggling adult life - although, I might have watched too many motivational youtube videos, so let's move on.Gameplay difficulty is at zero level, however, it's still quite enjoyable going through mini-games and being a part of interactive storytelling. Controls are quite simple, but I would recommend using your mouse, as it's more convenient (you will see why), but there's full controller support, if you prefer. Florence is unquestionably linear, but the illusion of choice and different interpretations of your own experience may give you something to ponder about at the end. I say: play it twice. The first time, when you are sad; the second time when you are happy. Test your emotions. Embrace the routine. Improve your St Valentine's Day.- Act III - RoutineOnce you beat the game, you'll have access to all the chapters separately, which is useful, if you want to go through all the achievements. It took me about an hour to complete 30 mins game which felt like a brief moment. I wanted more and I played it again. You know it's good when the time feels faster than it actually is. There are also rumors you can speedrun this game for ~15 mins, but I'm not even sure why I'm telling you this? Music also plays a significant role - it's quite lighthearted, but so on point and will dictate the swings of your mood. The original soundtrack is included, so you can listen to it anytime.- Act IV - The EndIn short: it's when simplicity beats everything. It is a simple yet beautiful experience, and after that short period of time with Florence you may forget the details, but you will remember how this game made you feel. Give it a try. Special thank you to the wonderful Samurai Punk team, who have ported this game to both PC & Switch and made this experience possible!  PS: Thank you all for reading - appreciate your time!

kgsizemo	推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198202715070/	My girl does not like crust! ---- SPOILERS!!!! ---- First, let me say that the score for this game is phenomenal! O.k., now that I've addressed that aspect, I will continue with my take on the game's plot.This plot reminds me of one of my favorite movies, La La Land. Although they are technically love stories, both Florence and La La Land have this seemingly tragic element to them. The relationships do not last. This does not mean that the time spent in said relationships were wasted.In Florence's case, both characters were stuck in ruts before they met, just going through the day-to-day motions. Once they met, and eventually began dating, they started to open up and share their thoughts. Their passions. Because they both developed care and affection for each other, they each pushed one another to pursue said passions. If not for Florence, Krish would not have applied for the music academy; If not for Krish, Florence might not have chased her dream of becoming an artist.Both Florence and Krish set one another on a better path than they were on.While Florence and Krish did not end up together, both hugely impacted one another. This is not a sad story. Sometimes people come into your life only for a season... and it can be a beautiful season! Just because the relationship did not last, that does not mean the memories, lessons, or admiration for the other person has to end as well.This game is good. Check it out.

Bodomi	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bodomi/	Florence is an overpriced 30-minute short novel with an un-relatable, and in my opinion horrible story and extremely monotonous 'puzzles'/mini-games that feels like homework for a young child, matching geometrical shapes together and solving math problems like 8+?=16.What I grasp from the moral of story is that: moms are annoying, digital things are bad, anything but homemade cultural meals are negative, a stable relationship with routine is bad, and a good career change in your mid-20's is to start doing something you did as a toddler and never again after that.The art and music is really good but I don't give games positive reviews because they had a wonderful art-style and good soundtrack, unlike most of the people who have given this game a positive review.In the end it sucked. It was boring, the moral of the story was horrible and the last half of the game was just a bunch of fanciful nonsense that would never happen in reality.It's a banal and dull love story. It tries to be deep, but it really isn't.If the game was longer with a lot more detail on how the 2 main characters relationship developed and way more detail on how she continued her sudden artist career it could maybe be a mediocre thing and not a waste of money, but not this 30-minute crap story with a very sudden ending of her deciding to pursue an art career because she drew as a child, like 99% of all children in her shoes did.Curator pageIf you liked this review or otherwise found it helpful in deciding whether or not to buy this game, feel free to follow my Curator page.Edit: All of a sudden my Steam Curator page link is being censored in this review, shows up just fine in all my other reviews.Edit edit: And it's back, after several hours.Edit edit edit: And a few days ago the review was completely removed from the store page.

O.k., now that I've addressed that aspect, I will continue with my take on the game's plot.This plot reminds me of one of my favorite movies, La La Land. Although they are technically love stories, both Florence and La La Land have this seemingly tragic element to them. The relationships do not last. This does not mean that the time spent in said relationships were wasted.In Florence's case, both characters were stuck in ruts before they met, just going through the day-to-day motions. Once they met, and eventually began dating, they started to open up and share their thoughts. Their passions. Because they both developed care and affection for each other, they each pushed one another to pursue said passions. If not for Florence, Krish would not have applied for the music academy; If not for Krish, Florence might not have chased her dream of becoming an artist.Both Florence and Krish set one another on a better path than they were on.While Florence and Krish did not end up together, both hugely impacted one another. This is not a sad story. Sometimes people come into your life only for a season... and it can be a beautiful season! Just because the relationship did not last, that does not mean the memories, lessons, or admiration for the other person has to end as well.This game is good. Check it out.

Bodomi	不推荐	总时数	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bodomi/	Florence is an overpriced 30-minute short novel with an un-relatable, and in my opinion horrible story and extremely monotonous 'puzzles'/mini-games that feels like homework for a young child, matching geometrical shapes together and solving math problems like 8+?=16.What I grasp from the moral of story is that: moms are annoying, digital things are bad, anything but homemade cultural meals are negative, a stable relationship with routine is bad, and a good career change in your mid-20's is to start doing something you did as a toddler and never again after that.The art and music is really good but I don't give games positive reviews because they had a wonderful art-style and good soundtrack, unlike most of the people who have given this game a positive review.In the end it sucked. It was boring, the moral of the story was horrible and the last half of the game was just a bunch of fanciful nonsense that would never happen in reality.It's a banal and dull love story. It tries to be deep, but it really isn't.If the game was longer with a lot more detail on how the 2 main characters relationship developed and way more detail on how she continued her sudden artist career it could maybe be a mediocre thing and not a waste of money, but not this 30-minute crap story with a very sudden ending of her deciding to pursue an art career because she drew as a child, like 99% of all children in her shoes did.Curator pageIf you liked this review or otherwise found it helpful in deciding whether or not to buy this game, feel free to follow my Curator page.Edit: All of a sudden my Steam Curator page link is being censored in this review, shows up just fine in all my other reviews.Edit edit: And it's back, after several hours.Edit edit edit: And a few days ago the review was completely removed from the store page. Good stuff :).Edit edit edit edit: For anyone wondering: This review was never re-instated. First my curator page link was censored and re-instated many hours later, then the review was removed from visibility and never put back.
